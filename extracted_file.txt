{'text': '(CNN) -- Fighting in the volatile Sudanese region of Darfur has sparked another wave of refugees into Chad and left a Red Cross employee dead, according to international agencies.\n\n\n\nRefugee camps in eastern Chad house about 300,000 people who fled violence in the Darfur region of Sudan.\n\n\n\nThe U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said on Monday that more than 12,000 people have fled militia attacks over the last few days from Sudan\'s Darfur region to neighboring Chad, still recovering from a recent attempt by rebels there to topple the government.\n\n\n\n"Most of the new arrivals in Chad had already been displaced in Darfur in recent years. They are really tired of being attacked and having to move," said UNHCR\'s Jorge Holly. "All the new refugees we talked to said they did not want to go back to Darfur at this point, they wanted to be transferred to a refugee camp in eastern Chad."\n\n\n\nThis latest influx of refugees in Chad aggravates an already deteriorating security situation across this politically unstable region of Africa.\n\n\n\nBefore the latest flight into Chad, the UNHCR and its partner groups "were taking care of 240,000 Sudanese refugees in 12 camps in eastern Chad and some 50,000 from Central African Republic in the south of the country." Up to 30,000 people in Chad fled the country for Cameroon during the rebel-government fighting.\n\n\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said on Monday that one of its employees was killed in western Darfur last week during fighting. The victim is a 45-year-old Sudanese national and father of six children.\n\n\n\nHe was killed in the area of Seleia, one of the three towns where reported government-backed Janjaweed militia attacks on Friday left around 200 people dead.\n\n\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week deplored the acts, urged all parties to stop hostilities, and said "all parties must adhere to international humanitarian law, which prohibits military attacks against civilians."\n\n\n\nThe United Nations says "more than 200,000 people have been killed and 2.2 million others forced to flee their homes since fighting began in 2003 among government forces, rebel groups and allied militia groups known as the Janjaweed."\n\n\n\nThe recent fight between Chad\'s government and rebels is seen as a proxy war over Darfur.

{'text': 'Johannesburg (CNN) -- Miffed by a visa delay that led the Dalai Lama to cancel a trip to South Africa, Archbishop Desmond Tutu lashed out at his government Tuesday, saying it had acted worse than apartheid regimes and had forgotten all that the nation stood for.\n\n\n\n\n\n"When we used to apply for passports under the apartheid government, we never knew until the last moment what their decision was," Tutu said at a news conference. "Our government is worse than the apartheid government because at least you were expecting it from the apartheid government.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I have to say that I can\'t believe this. I really can\'t believe this," Tutu said. "You have to wake me up and tell me this is actually happening here."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama scrapped his planned trip to South Africa this week after the nation failed to issue him a visa in time, his spokesman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisa applications for him and his entourage were submitted to the South African High Commission in New Delhi, India, at the end of August, and original passports were submitted on September 20, more than two weeks ago, a statement on his website said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, South Africa\'s foreign affairs office said it did not refuse a visa.\n\n\n\n\n\n"South Africa will not comment on the decision, because it is not our decision, it is his decision," according to spokesman Clayson Monyela, who said the visa application was still under consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama had been invited to the country to receive the Mahatma Gandhi International Award for Peace and Reconciliation and to speak at a number of events, including a lecture in honor of Tutu\'s 80th birthday. Tutu and the Dalai Lama are recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\n\n\n\nTutu said he would pray for the defeat of South Africa\'s government, led by the African National Congress (ANC), which is rooted in the fight against the system of apartheid, or legal racial separation, that was present in South Africa until 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n"You are disgraceful," Tutu said about the government. "You are behaving in a way that is totally at variance with the things for which we stood."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ANC plans to call on government officials to explain to South Africans why the visa process was delayed, spokesman Jackson Mtembu said. He said everyone was in the dark about this matter.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he also suggested that Tutu calm down. A comparison to apartheid regimes, he said, was unfair.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not the first time the Dalai Lama has not been able to visit South Africa. In 2009, South Africa refused the Tibetan spiritual leader a visa to attend an international peace conference, saying it was not in the country\'s interest for him to attend.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn refusing the 2009 application, South Africa said that if the Dalai Lama attended the conference, the focus would shift away from the 2010 World Cup, the global soccer championship it was hosting.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We cannot allow focus to shift to China and Tibet," presidential spokesman Thabo Masebe said, adding that South Africa had gained much from its trading relationship with China.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, and China pressures governments around the world to deny him any legitimacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeculation surfaced Tuesday that this year\'s visit was also affected by South Africa\'s relationship with China.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African Vice President Kgalema Motlanthe visited Beijing last week and met with Chinese President Hu Jintao to discuss bolstering bilateral ties.\n\n\n\n\n\nMotlanthe said South Africa was ready to boost the strategic partnership between the two countries to a new stage, according to the official Chinese news agency Xinhua.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Monyela said the application had nothing to do with China.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We are a sovereign nation which takes decisions in our domestic interest," Monyela said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama posted a message on Twitter last week that said: "Even if the Chinese leave nothing but ashes, Tibet will rise from these ashes as a free country even if it takes a long time to do so."\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Norgaard, CNN\'s Johannesburg bureau chief, contributed to this report.', 'questions': [{'question': 'who did say South Africa did not issue a visa on time?', 'answers': ['his spokesman', 'Desmond Tutu', 'Archbishop Desmond Tutu']}, {'question': 'who is responsible for all this', 'answers': ['his government', 'nation failed to issue him a visa in time,', 'government.']}, {'question': 'what is the African National Congress ?', 'answers': ['which is rooted in the fight against the system of apartheid, or legal racial separation, that was present in South Africa until 1994.', 'rooted', 'which', 'fight against the system of apartheid, or legal racial separation, that was present in South Africa until 1994.']}, {'question': 'Who does the African National Congress say should calm down?', 'answers': ['Tutu']}, {'question': 'Who says the government is acting worse than apartheid regime?', 'answers': ['Archbishop Desmond Tutu']}, {'question': 'Who was denied visa to South Africa in 2009?', 'answers': ['Dalai Lama']}]}

{'text': '(CNN) -- Pope John Paul II used to beat himself with a belt and sleep on a bare floor to bring himself closer to Christ, a book published Wednesday says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe late pope had a particular belt for self-flagellation and brought it with him to his summer residence, according to the book, "Why he is a Saint: The True story of John Paul II."\n\n\n\n\n\n"As some members of his own entourage were able to hear with their own ears, both in Poland and in the Vatican, Karol Wojtyla flagellated himself," the book says, using the name the pope was given at birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n"In the closet, among the cloaks, a particular pant-belt hung from a hook, which he utilized as a whip and one which he always had brought to Castel Gandolfo," the book says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe book was written by a Vatican insider, Slawomir Oder, with Italian journalist Saverio Gaeta of the Catholic weekly Christian Family. Oder is head of the Vatican committee investigating whether John Paul II should be declared a saint. John Paul died in 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe evil albino monk in Dan Brown\'s "The Da Vinci Code" may be the best-known example of self-flagellation these days, but the practice is not unusual in Catholicism -- or nearly as extreme as it is shown in the movie.\n\n\n\n\n\n"When members or former members [of Opus Dei] see the monk go at it in the movie, they just burst out laughing, it\'s so nutty," said the Rev. Michael Barrett, a priest of the Catholic Opus Dei sect.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn actual Catholic self-flagellation, "there is no blood, no injury, nothing to harm a person\'s health, nothing traumatic. If it caused any harm, the Church would not allow it," he wrote on Opus Dei\'s Web site when the movie came out in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\n"This voluntarily accepted discomfort is a way of joining oneself to Jesus Christ and the sufferings he voluntarily accepted in order to redeem us from sin. \'The Da Vinci Code\'s\' masochist monk, who loves pain for its own sake, has nothing to do with real Christian mortification," Barrett said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMother Teresa is among famous Catholics who self-flagellated in some way, Barrett said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholics are not alone in choosing to inflict pain on themselves for religion reasons. Some Shiite Muslims lash themselves until they bleed when marking the mourning period of Ashura, while fasting is practiced by people in several religions, including Jews on Yom Kippur, the day of atonement.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Gibson, a journalist who worked for Vatican Radio when John Paul II was pope, pointed out that the pontiff wrote an apostolic letter -- essentially a papal position paper -- on suffering in 1984.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Christ did not conceal from his listeners the need for suffering. He said very clearly: \'If any man would come after me ... let him take up his cross daily,\' " the pope wrote, quoting the Gospel of Luke.\n\n\n\n\n\nJesus, the pope wrote, "suffered in place of man and for man. Every man has his own share in the Redemption. Each one is also called to share in that suffering through which the Redemption was accomplished.\n\n\n\n\n\n"In bringing about the Redemption through suffering, Christ has also raised human suffering to the level of the Redemption. Thus each man, in his suffering, can also become a sharer in the redemptive suffering of Christ," says the letter, Salvifici Doloris, On the Christian Meaning of Human Suffering.\n\n\n\n\n\n"John Paul was a product of a very Old World Polish Catholicism," said Gibson, who now writes on religion for Politics Daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n"He was a very disciplined man and a very rigorous man in his personal spirituality," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authors of the new book clearly approve of any whipping the pope did of himself, he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Even though it\'s going to weird people out, it\'s obviously seen by his postulators as a sign of his holiness," he said, using the technical term for the person who investigates a person\'s qualifications for sainthood.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the idea is not as bizarre as it might sound to contemporary ears.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The idea of fasting, renouncing something, giving up your Starbucks latte so you can send money to Haiti -- you can\'t simply look down your nose at it without rejecting a lot of other ideas about self-sacrifice," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authors of the book based it on interviews with 114 "witnesses" and access to unedited documents in the Vatican\'s archives, according to the publisher, Rizzoli.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe book is available only in Italian, but the publisher is having it translated into Polish and other languages.', 'questions': [{'question': 'what Pope used to beat himself?', 'answers': ['John Paul II']}, {'question': 'who "a particular pant-belt" to beat himself, book says?', 'answers': ['Pope', 'John Paul II']}, {'question': 'who says "Why he is a Saint: The True story of John Paul II"?', 'answers': ['Slawomir Oder,']}, {'question': 'what Journalist compares flagellation to fasting or other?', 'answers': ['David Gibson,', 'Slawomir Oder,']}, {'question': 'what did he do', 'answers': ['used to beat himself with a belt and sleep on a bare floor', 'beat himself with a belt and sleep on', 'closer to Christ,', 'floor to bring himself']}, {'question': 'there John Paul II slept?', 'answers': ['bare floor']}, {'question': 'what pope is this', 'answers': ['John Paul II']}, {'question': 'when John Paul wrot a apostolic letter on suffering?', 'answers': ['1984.']}]}

{'text': 'TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran\'s parliament speaker has criticized U.S. President-elect Barack Obama for saying that Iran\'s development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable.\n\nIranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has outlined where he thinks U.S. policy needs to change.\n\nAli Larijani said Saturday that Obama should apply his campaign message of change to U.S. dealings with Iran.\n\n"Obama must know that the change that he talks about is not simply a superficial changing of colors or tactics," Larijani said in comments carried by the semi-official Mehr News Agency.\n\n"What is expected is a change in strategy, not the repetition of objections to Iran\'s nuclear program, which will be taking a step in the wrong direction."\n\nIn his first post-election news conference Friday afternoon, Obama reiterated that he believes a nuclear-armed Iran would be "unacceptable." He also said he would help mount an international effort to prevent it from happening.\n\nLarijani said that U.S. behavior toward Iran "will not change so simply" but that Obama\'s election showed internal conditions in the United States have shifted.\n\nHe added that Iran does not mind if the United States provides other Persian Gulf countries with nuclear technology, but "you should know that you cannot prevent the Islamic Republic [from reaching its goals in the nuclear field]," according to the news agency.\n\nObama cautioned Friday that it had only been a few days since the election and that he was not in office.\n\n"Obviously, how we approach and deal with a country like Iran is not something that we should simply do in a knee-jerk fashion. I think we\'ve got to think it through," Obama said.\n\n"But I have to reiterate once again that we only have one president at a time. And I want to be very careful that we are sending the right signals to the world as a whole that I am not the president, and I won\'t be until January 20th."\n\nLarijani was speaking two days after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad congratulated Obama, the first time an Iranian leader has offered such wishes to a U.S. president-elect since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nOne analyst said the welcome was a gesture from the hard-line president that he is open to a more conciliatory relationship with the United States.\n\nAhmadinejad said Tehran "welcomes basic and fair changes in U.S. policies and conducts," according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency on Thursday.\n\nRelations between the United States and Iran have historically been chilly and have been further strained in recent years over Iran\'s nuclear program.\n\nTehran insists that the program exists for peaceful purposes, but the United States and other Western nations are concerned by Iran\'s refusal to halt uranium enrichment activities.\n\nCNN\'s Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.', 'questions': [{'question': 'Iran criticizes who?', 'answers': ['U.S. President-elect Barack Obama', 'President-elect Barack Obama']}, {'question': 'What are US and Iran relations tensioned about?', 'answers': ['development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable.', 'nuclear program.']}, {'question': 'Who said Obama should apply campaign message?', 'answers': ['Ali Larijani']}, {'question': 'What should Obama apply according to speaker?', 'answers': ['his campaign message of change', 'U.S. dealings with Iran.', 'Ali Larijani']}, {'question': 'US - Iran tensions are high over what?', 'answers': ['nuclear weapon', 'development', 'nuclear program.']}, {'question': 'Who was the President of the US at this time?', 'answers': ['Barack Obama', 'Larijani', 'Mahmoud Ahmadinejad']}, {'question': "Who has tensions over Tehran's nuclear ambitions?", 'answers': ['U.S.', 'program, which will be taking a step in the wrong direction."', 'the United States', '"What is expected is a change in strategy, not the repetition of objections to Iran\'s']}, {'question': 'Who criticized Obama ?', 'answers': ["Iran's parliament speaker"]}, {'question': 'Parliamentary speaker says who should apply campaign message of change?', 'answers': ['of', 'to U.S. dealings with Iran.', 'U.S. President-elect Barack Obama', 'Obama', 'Ali Larijani said Saturday that Obama', 'his']}, {'question': 'What kind of weapons are being discussed?', 'answers': ['nuclear']}, {'question': 'Who criticized Obama for saying nuclear weapon development is unaccaptable?', 'answers': ['Ali Larijani', "Iran's parliament speaker", 'parliament speaker']}, {'question': 'What basic reason is there for US-Iranian tensions to be high?', 'answers': ['nuclear program,', 'nuclear technology,']}]}

{'text': '(CNN) -- A phone hacking scandal may have cost Rupert Murdoch his biggest-selling newspaper in 2011, but the billionaire media mogul managed to end the year with a modest addition to his empire -- an account on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin 48 hours of debuting with tweets about family, work and politics, Murdoch had pulled in more than 45,000 followers and stirred internet debate over why the 80-year-old was now embracing a technology often used to attack him.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tweets also raised doubts that the notorious technophobe was writing the messages himself. Twitter creator Jack Dorsey -- one of only four people being followed by Murdoch -- however insisted that the media mogul was writing "with his own voice, in his own way."\n\n\n\n\n\nMurdoch appears to have made his Twitter debut on New Year\'s Eve with a couple of brief comments on books including the biography of late Apple boss Steve Jobs, which he called "interesting but unfair."\n\n\n\n\n\nThese were followed by praise for cinema releases "We Bought a Zoo," and "The Descendants," both produced by Murdoch\'s Fox Movies. These fueled suspicions that Murdoch\'s Twitter account was being used as a publicity tool to help improve his image after a damaging year.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Could be brilliant News Corp PR operation," Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff tweeted after earlier commenting: "Might be somebody who knows Murdoch, but it\'s not Rupert (he doesn\'t use a computer unassisted nor get his own email)."\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers claimed that the voice of the tweets, as well as their faltering grammar and punctuation, were unmistakably Murdoch. "You can tell by the tweets he\'s doing it himself," wrote CNN\'s Piers Morgan, a former editor of one of Murdoch\'s newspapers.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Murdoch\'s News Corp. confirmed to CNN the account is genuine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe account could offer new insight into a businessman whose life has been under intense scrutiny this year after revelations that journalists at News of the World, one of his most profitable newspapers, illegally accessed the voicemail messages of scores of celebrities and public figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter played a prominent role at the height of the scandal when it was used to pressure advertisers into boycotting the paper. Commentators said the loss of revenue was a key factor in Murdoch\'s decision to shut the paper down.\n\n\n\n\n\nMurdoch\'s subsequent appearance before a British parliamentary inquiry into phone hacking also caused a sensation on Twitter, particularly after his wife, Wendi Deng, pounced on a man who tried to attack him with a foam pie.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were echoes of Murdoch\'s parliamentary appearance -- which he called the "most humble day day of my life" -- in New Year pledges which he tweeted in a January 1 message to Dorsey. "My resolutions, try to maintain humility and always curiosity. And of course diet!"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there were also signs that the media mogul was still getting to grips with social media. Reports suggested he was forced to quickly delete one post -- possibly after Deng leapt to his aid once again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald -- a fierce rival of his Australian publications -- was among news outlets claiming that Murdoch was guilty of "tweeting-before-thinking" for suggesting that the British have too many holidays for a "broke country."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe message was apparently removed, but not before someone tweeting as Wendi Deng implored: "RUPERT!!! delete tweet!" A further post on the unverified Deng account later added: "EVERY1 @rupertmurdoch was only having a joke pROMSIE!!!" [sic]\n\n\n\n\n\nMurdoch also follows an account that appears on the surface to be Google CEO Larry Page but is actually run by a man in Virginia. It\'s not clear whether Murdoch realizes he\'s not following the real Larry Page.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong other tweets by Murdoch, who also follows Zynga CEO Mark Pincus and Silcon Valley entrepreneur and British businessman Alan Sugar, were an expression of support for Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum.', 'questions': [{'question': 'How many followers does Rupert have?', 'answers': ['45,000']}, {'question': 'How many followers does Murdoch have on twitter?', 'answers': ['45,000']}, {'question': 'What do his tweets talk about?', 'answers': ['family, work', 'politics,', 'family, work and politics,']}, {'question': 'What is his age?', 'answers': ['80-year-old']}, {'question': 'what age is the person?', 'answers': ['80-year-old']}, {'question': 'What types of tweets does Murdoch write?', 'answers': ['about family, work and politics,', 'family, work and politics,']}, {'question': 'Which news channel was this information confirmed to?', 'answers': ['CNN']}, {'question': 'What is number of followers Murdoch has?', 'answers': ['45,000', 'more than 45,000']}]}
{'text': 'ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Jeremy Piven is the kind of guy who can make you laugh just by lifting an eyebrow.\n\n\n\nJeremy Piven stars as a used car salesman in "The Goods."

(HBO, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.)\n\n\n\nPiven stopped by the CNN.com newsroom to talk with CNN\'s Nicole Lapin about his new film, "The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard," in which he plays a used car salesman.\n\n\n\nThe following is an edited version of the interview:\n\n\n\nCNN: [The movie] was hysterical, and my producer and I were sitting next to each other and we were trying to figure out -- is this like lowbrow, but it\'s smart, so it\'s medium-brow? Highbrow comedy?\n\n\n\nJeremy Piven: It\'s a hybrid-brow, or a unibrow. It\'s from the people who brought you "Talladega Nights" and "Step Brothers" and "Anchorman," so from the kings of guys who make really smart, low-brow comedies, and I\'m just insanely honored to be a part of it.\n\n\n\nIt\'s like a dream because my fear was that by the time Will [Ferrell] hit the screen that, worst-case scenario, the movie wouldn\'t be funny enough. So that when Will jumps out of the plane, he takes us to a whole other level -- it\'s like, "Oh my God, Will Ferrell is so brilliant." But the reality is, the movie was so funny up until that moment that it was really, it was kind of organic, and it sustained it and it was really fantastic.  Watch why part of Piven\'s interview had to be bleeped out »\n\n\n\nJames Brolin would go home to his wife, Barbra Streisand, at night, and I would say, "James, is she OK with all this?" Because he has one of the most twisted roles you\'ve ever seen, as you know -- and I don\'t want to give it away. He was like, "Well, the wife is on the fence about this whole thing," and she came to a screening and I swear to God, Babs laughed the loudest.\n\n\n\nCNN: I think that\'s a tease in itself. That would probably get people to see it.\n\n\n\nPiven: Yes, I think you\'re right.

So I kind of took that, and I reversed it and I\'m no longer a sucker.\n\n\n\nCNN: Are you going to stick with "Entourage"?\n\n\n\nPiven: Well, I think "Entourage" ... this season is the sixth season, and it\'s I think the most interesting of all of them, and I kind of have the best arc this year.\n\n\n\nThe backstage life of Hollywood is such fertile stuff for our show that I think we could continue on for as long as it stays fresh.\n\n\n\nCNN: What about a movie?\n\n\n\nPiven: I think a movie would be really, really fun of "Entourage."

{'text': 'SAVANNAH, Georgia (CNN)  -- What does it really take to dress someone as fashion-forward and in the spotlight as Michelle Obama?\n\n\n\nDesigner Yigal Azrouël talks with students at the Savannah College of Art and Design.\n\n\n\n"Bravery," says Isabel Toledo, designer of the first lady\'s attention-grabbing lemongrass yellow wool and lace ensemble that she wore for the inauguration of her husband President Obama.\n\n\n\nBut along with bravery about their fashion sense, new graduates at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) will need courage in the face of the current recession.\n\n\n\n"Fashion is being hit particularly hard in the new job market. Fashion as a whole is feeling a greater level of lost revenues and in turn has lost opportunities for sustaining volume and even more so for growth," said Marshal Cohen, chief analyst and expert fashion analyst for the NPD market research group.\n\n\n\n"The ironic thing is that new ideas and creations are just what the industry needs but is too cautious to react to it," he added.\n\n\n\nFull of new ideas, student designers say they are aware of the challenges as they head out into the work force, but they\'re optimistic they can make it in these tough times.\n\n\n\n"After I graduate, I\'m going to New York, I have an internship lined up with a trend forecasting company, Promostyl," said Shelby Simon whose designs made it into SCAD\'s annual fashion show.

She would like to land an internship in New York and has interviewed with New York & Co. and applied for positions at Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein and Zac Posen.\n\n\n\nToledo, a world-renown designer, knows it can be tough to make it in fashion. She and her fashion illustrator husband Ruben Toledo didn\'t have much money when they arrived from Cuba in the late 60s as political refugees. She says she found inspiration in the little things.  Experts\' advice on getting to top of fashion business »\n\n\n\n"Go out there and look at things, look at things well. Study them; the smallest things can inspire you. That will make you able to do what you want on any level. Many times kids think you have to have all this backing coming into a big industry. I didn\'t do that, I started from the bottom and as a matter of fact you can only go up," said Isabel Toledo.\n\n\n\nToledo was at the school last weekend to accept the 2009 André Leon Talley Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n\n\nBut for six months, two other top designers, Yigal Azrouël and Lars Nilsson, have been mentoring and critiquing 23 students to help them develop their designs for the runway.\n\n\n\nAzrouël, a self-taught designer, says it\'s a tough industry and students have to pay their dues.\n\n\n\n"It\'s not what people think it is or what it looks like from the outside. If you want to be a fashion designer you have to carry fabric on your back, you need to learn how to cut and sew. The fame is going to come later."\n\n\n\nMore known for his expert draping techniques, Yigal Azrouël taught students more than how to incorporate intricate folds and pleats in their designs.\n\n\n\n"If you love something, go ahead and do it, but, be very consistent with it," advised Azrouël.\n\n\n\nSCAD senior Caitlin Clarke says working with Nilsson really helped her create new silhouettes and structured angles with interesting seams.\n\n\n\n"Lars was so helpful. I remember this one time when he came in and said \'Ah, there\'s something not right with this dress\' and then he helped me cut it up and fix it," said Clarke.\n\n\n\nNilsson enjoyed the process.\n\n\n\n"I really tried to spend a lot of time seeing what they [the students] had to say, giving them advice and push them forward to express themselves," said Nilsson. "It\'s been a great collaboration, and I must say that I\'ve learned a lot myself, too."\n\n\n\nThe visiting designers give the students an edge in their job search, says SCAD president Paula Wallace. "It\'s very important to bring in the top professionals because they inspire the students and they provide contacts and networking for the students after they graduate."\n\n\n\nStudents are also using social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and MySpace to reach out to their peers and other industry professionals. In order to succeed you have to have innovative approaches to market, sell and sustain your product lines, said retail analyst Hitha Prabhakar.\n\n\n\nRight now retailers are in "survival of the fittest" mode and a handful of designers including Mui Mui, Allessandro Del Acqua, Allegra Hicks and Krizia have had to shut their store doors on Madison Avenue, she said.\n\n\n\nSCAD senior Shelby Simon feels some students went into fashion because they like to shop, but she warns there is so much more to learn about the craft..\n\n\n\n"The truth is hard work, nose to the grind stone and learning.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Les Paul never stopped tinkering, said Henry Juszkiewicz.\n\n\n\nLes Paul was constantly making recommendations on how to improve guitars, says the CEO of Gibson.\n\n\n\nJuszkiewicz, the chairman and CEO of Gibson Guitars, remembers getting calls from his company\'s partner (and famed client), offering recommendations on how to change or market his eponymous Gibson guitars.\n\n\n\nSometimes, Juszkiewicz recalls, the two would go out for Chinese food. Paul was very particular, desiring a dish called Chicken Subgum. The two would have to search Chinatown for a restaurant that knew how to cook it, he says with a chuckle.\n\n\n\nLes Paul died Thursday of pneumonia. He was 94.\n\n\n\nJuszkiewicz talked about his friend and colleague Thursday afternoon. The following is an edited version of the interview.  Watch how Les Paul helped invent modern music »\n\n\n\nCNN: Tell me about working with Les Paul.\n\n\n\nHenry Juszkiewicz: I\'ve been with Gibson about 25 years and known Les pretty much through that entire period. ... Les was a very kind person. He was a visionary.\n\n\n\nIn the early days, Gibson was doing very poorly as a company, and I got involved essentially to turn the company around. ... We had many, many conversations about the guitar business and what to do. ... A lot of the things we talked about and implemented were very successful.\n\n\n\nCNN: What was distinctive about the Gibson Les Paul when it came out, and what remains distinctive about it?  Gallery: Guitarists pay tribute to Les Paul »\n\n\n\nJuszkiewicz: When it first came out, it was extremely controversial, and it was not really successful. It took years for Gibson to actually come to terms with Les. He had been pitching the head of what was Gibson\'s parent company, CMI, for three or four years until they finally decided to give it a try -- and only then when he became very famous and a television personality.\n\n\n\nAnd they were right, actually, because a solid-body guitar was considered silly. ... It really wasn\'t until 1965, \'66 that the guitar took off and became popular. In fact, in the early \'60s, the guitar was discontinued for several years. One of the [prized] Les Pauls was the 1959 Les Paul -- that\'s sort of the holy grail of Les Pauls -- and one of the reasons is there were only 300 units made in 1959. And 300 units was not really that successful for Gibson; it was a powerhouse guitar builder in 1959.\n\n\n\nSo Les was always ahead of his time. He was someone who could see what was going to happen 50 years in advance, and very often, he was able to bring his vision to reality and share it with the entire musical community. ...\n\n\n\nThe [Les Paul] guitar shines in modern music. ... In the \'50s and before the \'50s, the [standard] guitar was amplified, but it was just louder. In other words, it still sounded just like an acoustic guitar, but you could turn it up. What Les did was turn it into a whole new instrument. When he was playing ... you will hear this rich context that\'s kind of normal today. ...\n\n\n\nCNN: Les Paul being Les Paul, I assumed he continue to play with things over the years.\n\n\n\nJuszkiewicz: Yeah, he would call me all the time and give me suggestions. It\'s really hard to answer your original question, what makes it [distinctive]. ... As a guitar player, when I pick it up, I know it\'s a Les Paul. I can feel the sustain. It\'s got a certain feeling. ... There\'s a lot of things in it. But it\'s the package that\'s kind of magic. In the modern world, working with modern equipment, it\'s incomparable.\n\n\n\nCNN: How many Les Pauls do you sell nowadays?\n\n\n\nJuszkiewicz: A lot. Many, many thousands.\n\n\n\nI\'ll share with you: We had a big debate when we first got involved in the business. When I was a young guitar player, Les Pauls were always very expensive ... and they\'re very expensive today. [Paul] said, "You know, Henry, you really have to make a less expensive Les Paul." ... We argued about it for a year and a half, and finally I gave in. I said, "OK, Les, it\'s your guitar." ...\n\n\n\nAnd it was an instant success. And all of a sudden, people that couldn\'t touch that magic got a shot at it, and he was pleased as punch, and we were as well.\n\n\n\nHe was a renaissance man. ... What a life.

{'text': 'United Nations (CNN) -- Confronted with the prospect of a Palestinian bid for full U.N. membership, U.S. President Barack Obama issued a sharp rebuke Wednesday to those pressing for statehood -- a rebuke likely to bring criticism from the Arab world.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the U.N.," Obama said, addressing delegates at the 66th annual session of U.N. General Assembly. "If it were that easy, it would have been accomplished by now."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States has vowed to block a Palestinian membership application should it reach the Security Council, but is likely eager to head off a scenario that would involve an American veto -- a move widely seen as unpopular across the Middle East.\n\n\n\n\n\nA formal request for full U.N. membership is expected to be submitted Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n"One year ago, I stood at this podium and called for an independent Palestine," Obama added. "I believed then -- and I believe now -- that the Palestinian people deserve a state of their own. But what I also said is that genuine peace can only be realized between Israelis and Palestinians themselves."\n\n\n\n\n\nA year later, despite extensive U.S. efforts, "the parties have not bridged their differences," Obama said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American president met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and declared the bonds between their two countries "unbreakable," a move likely to play well at home in an increasingly volatile U.S. political landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough Netanyahu was not in attendance at the General Assembly during Obama\'s speech, he called the U.S. position a "badge of honor," and has pushed for a resumption of talks, beginning in New York and continuing in Ramallah and Jerusalem.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeace negotiations broke down last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas met with Obama later Wednesday, part of a whirlwind of diplomatic wrangling that has accompanied his proposed move. Obama reiterated his stance on the need for a two-state solution, officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbas met earlier with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who promised the request would be taken "very seriously," according to Nabeel Shaath, a senior negotiator for the Palestine Liberation Organization. Shaath told CNN it had not been decided if the formal application would be submitted the U.N. secretary-general before or after Abbas addresses the General Assembly early Friday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nBan said it will "not take long" to get Security Council consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\nShaath added that settling for a lesser status -- such as being recognized as a non-member state -- is one option under consideration if the push for full membership is blocked. But the Palestinians do not want "anybody to suspect a lack of seriousness," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestinians\' current status at the United Nations is as an observer "entity." Observers can speak in the General Assembly but not vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile a veto by the United States in the Security Council would block any effort to gain full U.N. membership, a "yes" vote in the General Assembly -- where only a majority would be needed -- would raise Palestinians to the status of permanent observer "state," the status the Vatican currently holds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbas\' effort to gain U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state is opposed by Hamas, the Palestinian organization that controls Gaza. It has warned Abbas against making the request, saying it would show a willingness to acknowledge and negotiate with Israel, which would "deprive the Palestinian people from their right to come back to their homeland."\n\n\n\n\n\nAs national leaders took to rostrum Wednesday to spell out their visions for global peace and security, attention at the U.N. General Assembly seemed to center on the potential membership bid.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy urged the body to recognize Palestine as a non-member state, calling for a more definitive timetable for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. But he also warned that a U.S. veto of the bid for full membership in the Security Council could be dangerous and might spark violence.\n\n\n\n\n\nArgentinean President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner seemed to agree, adding that "non-inclusion of Palestine (at the United Nations) this year will create greater insecurity."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Palestinian leader said he will personally deliver the application to the U.N. Security Council, but does not expect the body to act immediately, according to Palestinian officials.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey say Abbas is expected to deliver the letter before he leaves New York on Friday, but added that he will give both the United Nations and American leadership several weeks to respond to the letter -- temporarily averting a diplomatic showdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbas will wait for a response from the diplomatic Quartet on the Middle East, the officials said, and then return to the U.N. General Assembly to negotiate statehood recognition, working through the U.N. Security Council.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbas\' goal, according to the officials, is to legitimize Palestinian statehood by eventually forcing a vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff, who kicked off the opening round of speeches at the assembly\'s 66th session, joined the chorus of voices on Wednesday calling on the council to approve the Palestinian bid.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer speech marked the first time a woman has commenced the annual proceeding, reflecting a moment of equality at the start of what she described as "the century of women."\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Wednesday, Obama pressed Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan --- an increasingly vocal critic of Israel -- to continue work toward patching up their strained relationship, officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.N. chief, meanwhile, also focused on a series of other issues highlighted during the annual session, particularly the spread of noncommunicable diseases, empowering women, food security and climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth -- these are one and the same fight," said Ban. "Today, I call on you to reach a binding climate change agreement -- an agreement with more ambitious national and global emissions targets."\n\n\n\n\n\nThirty-one of the world body\'s 193 delegates are expected to address the assembly this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazil has traditionally opened the session since the days of former American president Harry Truman, when the U.N. was in its infancy. It was founded in 1945 after World War II.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Elise Labott, Richard Roth, Alan Silverleib and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.', 'questions': [{'question': 'What did the French president say?', 'answers': ['urged the body to recognize Palestine as a non-member state, calling for a more definitive timetable for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

{'text': '(CNN Student News)  -- Discussion Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n1. When is Black History Month observed? When did Black History Month get its start? Who was Dr. Carter G. Woodson? What was his role in the establishment of Black History Month?\n\n\n\n\n\n2. What are some significant events and milestones in U.S. black history? Who are some of the individuals who have contributed to black history?\n\n\n\n\n\n3. How does black history help to tell the story of what it means to be an American? How have African-Americans enriched that story? What lessons can be learned from the experiences of black history makers?\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activities\n\n\n\n\n\nUse these activities to encourage your students to learn about and appreciate the history, culture and achievements of African-Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. A Milestone in U.S. History\n\n\n\n\n\nRemind students that they have witnessed a truly historical event in their lifetime: the election of Barack Obama as the first African-American president. What will they remember about this milestone? What do they want future generations to know about it? Challenge students to write letters to students who will be in their place 100 years from now, describing the event and its significance for all Americans. Combine the letters into a book or a Web site, or create a video of students reading their letters. Present the finished product to your school\'s historian or media specialist for archiving.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Covering Black History\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk students: What if CNN correspondents had been on the scene to record key moments in black history for the entire world to see? Organize students into small teams of reporters, and have each team select a time period in American history and a key figure or event that helped to define that time period for African-Americans. Then, have students imagine that CNN was there to cover the historical figure or event. Ask: How do you think that CNN reporters might have covered these stories? Encourage the teams to write scripts for news stories on their historical figures and events. After students have presented their scripts, have them compare their reports to eyewitness accounts and local newspaper reports that were written at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Harlem Renaissance\n\n\n\n\n\nInform students that during the 1920s and 1930s, an African-American cultural movement occurred in the United States that was known as the Harlem Renaissance. It was a literary, musical and artistic explosion that was born in Harlem, New York, and it had a profound impact on African-American culture and on the U.S. as a whole. Have your class host a Harlem Renaissance cultural fair. Direct students to online resources to learn about some of the great artists, writers and musicians who were part of the renaissance and their contribution to this cultural movement.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave each student select one of these African-American artists and design a display that tells about the life and times of the artist and the importance of his or her work. Invite guests from your school and community to attend the exhibit. Have students serve as "roaming curators" to instruct and interest guests in the Harlem Renaissance and the creative works of these great African-Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Profiles in Black History\n\n\n\n\n\nDo your students show a personal interest in science, music, politics, theater, sports or education? Inspire them to celebrate the contributions of African-Americans by having them write profiles of African-Americans in the categories that interest them. For example, a budding young scientist might choose to profile the inventor of the ironing board, the lawn mower or the space shuttle retrieval arm, all of whom were/are African-Americans. Direct your students to online and print resources and have them conduct research on their chosen individuals. Then, encourage students to write proposals to have their selected persons commemorated in new postage stamps. Students should accompany their proposals with designs for the stamps. In their presentations, students should try to convince classmates why their profiled persons should have a stamp created in their name. Post the designs around the classroom.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Local African-American History\n\n\n\n\n\nValuable lessons in black history may be found just a few steps away in the stories and documents that can be found in local libraries, historical organizations, universities or colleges, and online. Encourage students to venture out into the community to investigate the history and contributions of black Americans in their city or town. Students might choose to use milestones in black history as a way to organize their research, gathering information on how those events impacted the community and its residents. They may also decide to profile influential black community members. Have students invite community members to a celebration of local black history.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Black History Museum\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrate black history by creating plans for a local Black History Museum. First, have students decide where the museum should be housed. Suggestions might include a school or local library, an exhibit in an existing history museum, or perhaps a virtual online museum. Next, discuss how the museum should be organized. Students may choose to categorize the content by theme, by specific time periods, by specific dates, by people or by local landmarks. Encourage students to include interactive elements and multimedia in their plans. Then, challenge students to consider what people, events or contributions to include in their Black History Museum. Ask: What messages or lessons do you want visitors to take away from the exhibits?\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Not Just for February\n\n\n\n\n\nInform students that, while Dr. Carter G. Woodson chose the month of February to recognize the accomplishments of African-Americans, black history can be celebrated all year long. Challenge students to create year-long calendars or timelines that highlight the contributions of African-American newsmakers, illustrate key events in black history, and encourage an ongoing celebration of black culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nStandards\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Studies\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Time, Continuity, and Change\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of the ways human beings view themselves in and over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nV.

{'text': "(CNN) -- Two goals in five minutes at the start of extra-time helped defending champions Egypt book their place in the African Nations Cup semifinals with a battling 3-1 victory over Cameroon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game, though, was marred by a controversial third goal by midfielder Ahmed Hassan which was allowed to stand by referee Jerome Damon despite replays showing the ball had clearly not crossed the line.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy that time the Pharaohs' captain, who was winning a record 170th cap for his country, had already scored an own goal to put the Indomitable Lions ahead after 26 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nHassan scored again at the other end to pull his side level with a powerful long-range strike before half-time which eventually forced the game into an additional 30 minutes in Benguela.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstitute Mohamed Gedo then capitalized on an error from Geremi Njitap to put Egypt ahead in extra-time, before Hassan's controversial strike handed them a two-goal cushion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make matters worse for Paul Le Guen's Cameroon, Aurelien Chedjou was sent off late on as the north Africans set up a tantalising last-four clash with old foes Algeria.\n\n\n\n\n\nCameroon took the lead following a spell of intense pressure. A succession of Achille Emana corners had the Egyptian defence wobbling -- and the seventh one resulted in Hassan's weak-header on the line dropping into his own net.\n\n\n\n\n\nCameroon pressed for a second goal but were taken by surprise when Hassan unleashed a fierce 35-yard strike in the 37th minute that deceived goalkeeper Carlos Kameni before finding its way in.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmad Moteab could have won the game for Egypt right at the death after he was picked out at the back post by a sweeping pass from Hassan, but the Al-Ahly forward could only find the side netting as the game entered extra-time.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Hassan Shehata's side wasted no time in killing off the tie going 3-1 up after 95 minutes -- after being gifted both goals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first came  when Geremi's poor back-pass from the right was intercepted by Gedo, who and tucked away with ease through the legs of Kameni two minutes after the resumption.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second seems certain to land South African referee Damon in the spotlight after Hassan's free-kick from the left was pushed onto the underside of the crossbar by the Espanyol goalkeeper and did not cross the line when it hit the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it was still allowed to stand much to the dismay of the Cameroon players. It also seemed to knock the stuffing out of Le Guen's men as they failed to create any major openings in the closing 25 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add insult to injury, Chedjou was shown a straight red for hauling down last-man Gedo midway through the second period of extra-time with Egypt going on to seal a memorable win.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria became the fourth team to reach the semifinals after defeating Zambia in a dull final quarterfinal showdown in Lubango.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeither side could find the net after 90 minutes and 30 minutes of extra time, but Nigeria progressed 5-4 on penalties and will now face near-neighbors Ghana in the last four on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoalkeeper Vincent Enyeama scored the decisive penalty for Nigeria after Thomas Nyirenda had missed for Zambia.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnyeama dived to his right to stop Nyirenda's penalty after Sikombe Chivhuta and Christopher Katongo and Emmanuel Mayuka had all scored for Zambia.\n\n\n\n\n\nObefemi Martins, Victor Nsofor, Peter Odemwingie, and John Obi Mikel all scored for Nigeria.", 'questions': [{'question': 'what did nigeria become', 'answers': ['fourth team to reach the semifinals']}, {'question': 'WHo booked their place', 'answers': ['Egypt']}, {'question': 'Who does Nigeria play?', 'answers': ['Ghana', 'will now face', 'Egypt']}, {'question': 'Who are the defending champions?', 'answers': ['Egypt']}, {'question': 'what did egypt do', 'answers': ['their place in the African Nations Cup semifinals with a battling 3-1 victory over Cameroon.', 'their place in the African Nations Cup semifinals', 'book']}, {'question': 'how many goals did egypt score', 'answers': ['Two', '3-1']}, {'question': 'What day was the game', 'answers': ['Thursday.']}, {'question': 'What is the competition', 'answers': ['African Nations Cup semifinals', 'the African Nations Cup semifinals']}, {'question': 'Egypt scored how many goals?', 'answers': ['Two']}]}

The company, based in Battle Creek, Michigan, made short order of the already-printed and filled boxes, donating two tons of cereal to the San Francisco Food Bank late last month.\n\n\n\nWith food banks across the country reporting shortages of food, the donation was a welcome one, said the food bank\'s director of development, Christopher Wiley. It took only two weeks for about 3,000 boxes to move through warehouse.\n\n\n\n"Thousands of families benefited from the donation" Wiley said. "It was a surprise to us. We were lacking a lot of cereal. It is a great product many low-income families really need."\n\n\n\n"The real story for us was not the box but what\'s inside the box.

Officials in Washington and Bishkek signed a deal three years ago allowing the United States to renew the arrangement annually through July 2011.\n\n"We do remain in contact with the government of Kyrgyzstan," Yerkin said. "The Manas Air Base continues to operate under existing agreements, as per the coalition\'s efforts in Afghanistan."\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Friday the United States will continue to work with Kyrgyzstan on keeping the base open.

"If we are unable to do that on reasonable terms then, as I have suggested, we are developing alternative methods to get resupply and people into Afghanistan."\n\nThe Manas Air Base outside Bishkek is the only U.S. base in Central Asia and is a major resupply hub for the war in Afghanistan.\n\nIts closing could deal a significant blow to the U.S. military effort there, especially following President Barack Obama\'s announcement of additional troops to halt a resurgence of the country\'s former Taliban rulers.\n\nThe United States pays $17.4 million a year to use Manas, a major logistical and refueling center that supports troops in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said. About 15,000 troops and 500 tons of cargo reportedly move through Manas monthly, it said.\n\nThe air base currently employs more than 1,000 servicemen, 95 percent of whom are Americans, Russia\'s Interfax news agency reported.\n\n"This is an important facility, it has been an important facility, but it\'s not irreplaceable and, if necessary, we will find other options," Whitman said.

{'text': 'Cleveland, Ohio (CNN) -- The niece of the mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, once lived with murder suspect Anthony Sowell, a registered sex offender charged with murder after the remains of 11 victims were found at his home, a spokeswoman for the mayor said Monday.\n\n\n\nLori Frazier, niece of Mayor Frank Jackson, had a relationship with Sowell that ended two years ago, said Andrea Taylor, a spokeswoman for Jackson\'s office. Taylor said it is unclear whether the relationship was romantic.\n\n\n\n"I just want to know why, why he would do this," Frazier told CNN affiliate WOIO on Friday. "He took care of me, good care of me. I never would have thought there were some bodies in the house."\n\n\n\n"I lived with him from 2005 to 2007 and he didn\'t kill me, but he killed all these girls," she said.\n\n\n\nSowell, 50, is facing five counts of aggravated murder, rape, felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with the deaths. All the victims were African-American women. All that remains of one of them is a skull, wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the basement.\n\n\n\nSowell served 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted rape in 1989. He was released in 2005.\n\n\n\nSo far, nine of the 11 victims found at Sowell\'s home have been identified. The latest two were identified Monday by the Cuyahoga County Coroner\'s Office, police said. They are Janice Webb, 49, and Kim Yvette Smith, who was 43 when last seen. Both women were from Cleveland.\n\n\n\nWebb was last seen on June 3 and was reported missing on August 2, police said. Smith was last seen January 1, but was not reported missing until November 2.\n\n\n\nA grand jury on Monday returned an indictment against Sowell in connection with an alleged assault and rape of a 36-year-old woman September 22, Cuyahoga County prosecutors said in a news release. The investigation into that incident was what led police, armed with a search warrant, to Sowell\'s home, where they discovered the bodies late last month.\n\n\n\nThe alleged victim encountered Sowell while walking in the neighborhood, and he took her back to his home, where he became violent and raped her, prosecutors said. "While raping her, he strangled her with a cord until she lost consciousness," the statement said. "When she regained consciousness, he led her out of the house."\n\n\n\nSowell faces a charge of attempted murder in the incident, along with two counts of rape, two counts of kidnapping and two counts of felonious assault, authorities said.\n\n\n\nSowell will be arraigned on the new charges Friday, authorities said.\n\n\n\nThe charges are first-degree felonies except for the assault charges, which are second-degree felonies, prosecutors said. If convicted, he would face a sentence of up to life in prison.\n\n\n\nThe investigation into the homicides continues, prosecutor Bill Mason said in the news release.\n\n\n\n"Upon completion of the investigation, the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor\'s Office working with the Cleveland Police Department will present evidence to the grand jury seeking the death penalty for these heinous murders committed by Sowell."\n\n\n\nResidents of the area near the home said they had noted a smell in the neighborhood, but assumed it was from nearby Ray\'s Sausage Company.\n\n\n\nAsked whether she had noticed a foul odor, Frazier told WOIO, "Yeah, I smelled stuff, but he always told me that -- at first he said it was his stepmother downstairs. And then I guess after she left, he told me that it was Ray\'s Sausage."\n\n\n\nFrazier said Sowell brought other women to the home when she was not there.\n\n\n\n"I love my niece very much and while she has made some decisions that have not been in her best interest, she has my full support," Jackson said in a written statement.\n\n\n\n"As a family, we are extremely fortunate that she was not a victim in this case as she did have a prior relationship with the suspect that ended approximately two years ago. My focus continues to be on making sure the loved ones of the victims get the attention, closure and justice they deserve and it is my hope that everyone remains committed to that goal."\n\n\n\nHundreds of Cleveland residents gathered outside the house Sunday night to remember the victims.\n\n\n\n"It\'s hard, because I want to burn it down," said Inez Fortson, whose daughter Telacia, 31 and a mother of three children, is among the dead.\n\n\n\nSowell has been placed on a suicide watch at the request of his attorney, according to Sowell\'s public defender, Kathleen DeMetz. A psychiatric evaluation has been ordered but it\'s unlikely to happen until after the case goes before a grand jury, the next expected step.\n\n\n\nPolice recovered the first bodies after they went to Sowell\'s home to follow up on a rape accusation.\n\n\n\nIn a separate incident, neighbors on October 20 reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor. Firefighters and paramedics responded, and later notified police. But the woman told officers that she was at the home "partying," when she fell off the roof, and no charges were filed.\n\n\n\nAgents from the FBI\'s Behavioral Science Unit are assisting Cleveland police, Cleveland FBI spokesman Scott Wilson has said. The agents are preparing a profile of Sowell for police, tracing his life and habits, and his DNA will be entered into a national database to see whether it can be linked to any unsolved crimes.\n\n\n\n"Our experts tell us it\'s likely he\'s done this before," said Frank Figliuzzi, special agent in charge of the FBI\'s Cleveland office. "He\'s probably done it elsewhere, and so we need to determine whether or not he\'s responsible for other unsolved murders and rapes around the country."\n\n\n\nIn addition, the FBI is investigating whether Sowell might be linked to crimes abroad, Figliuzzi said.\n\n\n\n"We know, for example, he was a Marine, he was assigned to California, he served in Okinawa, Japan, and we\'ll be matching all the facts from these crimes here in Cleveland with the crimes that remain unsolved in our database, and we\'ll specifically be looking at those locations where he\'s previously lived."\n\n\n\nAllen Sowell, the suspect\'s half-brother, told CNN he last saw his brother more than 20 years ago. Their stepmother, who lived in the house after Anthony Sowell got out of prison, said she knew of nothing odd going on at the time, Allen Sowell said.\n\n\n\nThe stepmother tried to get Anthony Sowell evicted from the house in 2007 because he wasn\'t paying rent, Allen Sowell said. Anthony Sowell said he shouldn\'t have to pay rent on a house that belonged to his father, who died in 2004.  Anthony Sowell remained in the house when his stepmother had to be hospitalized in 2007, his half-brother said.\n\n\n\nAllen Sowell said he was aware of his half-brother\'s prison record, but "just couldn\'t fathom" the accusations now facing him.\n\n\n\n"I didn\'t think he was in that bad of a mental state," Allen Sowell said. "You never think it would happen to your family. It\'s a horrible feeling."\n\n\n\nAt 66, Allen Sowell is 16 years older than his half-brother, and the two didn\'t meet until Anthony Sowell was 9.\n\n\n\nHe added, "He deserves whatever he gets from the justice system."\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Susan Candiotti, Edmund Demarche and Ross Levitt and CNN Radio\'s Brendan Gage contributed to this report.', 'questions': [{'question': 'What did Frank Jackson say?', 'answers': ['"I love my niece very much and while she has made some decisions that have not been in her best interest, she has my full support,"', '"I just want to know why, why he would do this,"', '"He took care of me, good care of me.

The teen, who is being referred to as Jane Doe, continues, "I want to know who I am and what happened to me."\n\n\n\nThe Caucasian young woman, described by New York ACS as "very soft-spoken," is 5 feet, 6 inches tall, light-skinned, with short, straight, cropped blond hair and blue eyes. Doctors are estimating her age to be between 14 and 17.\n\n\n\nACS Commissioner John B. Mattingly appealed to the public in a statement, "asking anyone who may know this young woman to help us locate her family as quickly as possible, so we can safely reunite her with those who love her."\n\n\n\nThe girl was found in midtown Manhattan around 12:30 a.m. October 9 outside the Covenant House youth shelter, although the organization tells CNN that she was not a resident at the time and did not appear as if she intended to seek refuge at the facility.\n\n\n\nAccording to its Web site, with nearly 7,000 youths seeking shelter per year, "Covenant House New York is the nation\'s largest adolescent care agency serving homeless, runaway and at-risk youth."\n\n\n\nA security guard for the shelter noticed the girl walking around on the sidewalk near Covenant House and approached her. Finding her unresponsive, he called the New York City Police Department.\n\n\n\nPolice officers interviewed the young woman, but it became clear that she couldn\'t provide authorities with any information about herself. The NYPD said she was wearing military green camouflage pants, a black shirt and a pair of black sneakers when she was discovered.\n\n\n\nChildren\'s Services said the girl recently wrote down the name "Amber" and has responded to it on one occasion, but she has no idea whether it is her true name.\n\n\n\nOn another occasion she is said to have recalled certain words, which turned out to be an excerpt from the fantasy novel "Fool\'s Fate" by Robin Hobb. The girl is also apparently writing a fantasy story of her own that features a heroine named Rian, "who\'s been raised by the commander of the guard post on the edge of a fantasy kingdom," says the young woman.\n\n\n\nThe girl has a 2- to 4-inch scar on her lower left back and had a black, handwritten birthday message on her arm, addressed to a name of Japanese origin, when she was found, police said Friday.\n\n\n\nJudging from poor dental hygiene, said Lt. Christopher Zimmerman, she appears to have been living on the streets for some time.\n\n\n\n"This case has been going on since October 9," Zimmerman said.

{'text': 'New York (CNN) -- Decades ago, when the Department of Defense was creating the predecessor to today\'s Internet, one of the main goals was to create a communications system that could endure catastrophic disasters.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Internet was designed to have no central point of failure, allowing anyone to run his or her own communications channel. This was a system that could withstand a nuclear attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the days since the Haiti earthquake, the popular social networking and microblogging service has been used for rescue efforts and for fundraising to help stabilize and rebuild the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it was big news when Twitter was offline for 90 minutes  Wednesday morning. Technology pundits promptly began hand-wringing -- the weaknesses of having a single point of failure to critical communications had been revealed again! Could we trust Twitter? Did this mean the Web couldn\'t help us fulfill our most basic obligations to those in need?\n\n\n\n\n\nNot at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\'s no reason that organizations or individuals who want to use the Web to relay critical information have to rely on Twitter or Facebook or Google or any other giant of the technology industry in the first place. We\'ve just forgotten a bit about how the Internet was supposed to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nRescue organizations and charities should simply be able to use the Web sites they already have to deliver those messages.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd wasn\'t that the promise of the Web in the first place? Weren\'t we going to stop relying on individual companies as gatekeepers for communication? When blogs took off a few years ago, wasn\'t it with the promise that we\'d all be able to share our voices without having to ask any company for permission? Why did we give that up?\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe it\'s because they made it look so easy.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter has done an impressive job of growing to handle its enormous number of users, while keeping its service simple. The company has even shown a reassuring sensitivity to the civic and social obligations that come from running such a popular communication service. Companies such as Facebook and Google have stepped up, too. Their hearts appear to be in the right place, and they\'re doing real work to help people communicate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Web is bigger than any one site or any one social network. In my own work, I run a nonprofit that strives to connect government policymakers to the expertise of ordinary people using the Web.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\'ll naturally make great use of Twitter and Facebook and all the other services, but it\'d be unforgivable to pick only one of them as a platform for civic engagement. Telling people the only way to talk to the White House is on Facebook is like saying you can only call your senator by using a particular phone company.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that\'s the key lesson to learn from Twitter being down while people are depending on it for communication: Some needs are too important to put in the hands of any single company. Communicating in real time about emergency information is clearly one of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately there\'s good news. Smart inventors have already made cutting-edge technologies that let any site deliver messages with the same immediacy as Twitter or Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the challenge is reminding all of the social institutions, media organizations and government agencies that they need to use their own communications infrastructure just as much as they participate in services such as Twitter and Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reality is social networks come and go.\n\n\n\n\n\nTen years ago, otherwise-sensible companies were paying millions of dollars to America Online to buy "AOL keywords." These were shortcuts to parts of the AOL service, which dominated U.S. Internet access at the time. In fact, many of us have allowed companies to become intermediaries to all our communications, whether it was AOL 10 years ago or Facebook today.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we don\'t need to ask gateways for permission to publish. We can run our own Web sites, at our own Web addresses and keep control over how we communicate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThink how ludicrous it would seem for someone to decide, say, to offer emergency services as an AOL keyword called "911" instead of having people just dial their phones?\n\n\n\n\n\nThat sounds absurd, but you can see advertisements today that essentially say "Find us on Facebook at facebook.com/AcmeWidgets!"\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, Facebook probably won\'t fade away entirely, like early networks such as Friendster. But those Facebook addresses are just like AOL keywords 10 years earlier. And it is conceivable that the organizations and companies who communicate on Facebook today may want to become more independent.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether due to emergency or just the everyday requirements of doing business, they ultimately will stop depending on a single point of contact for their communications.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is, after all, how the Web was designed to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe already see governments and civic organizations using the Web as effectively as the best corporations and media. In the United States, we have a White House that\'s got an iPhone application and a State Department that\'s asking us to define democracy by responding on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\nJudging by how much technology has affected society already, those first experiments will soon evolve into full-fledged platforms for citizen participation and charitable action. And let\'s hope they won\'t have to worry if any one Web site goes down. Because we\'ll have a web of independent but connected communications systems, just as the Internet was always designed to be.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anil Dash.', 'questions': [{'question': 'who is anil dash', 'answers': ['opinions expressed in this commentary', 'The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of']}, {'question': 'What did Anil Dash say the internet was designed for?', 'answers': ['to have no central point of failure,', 'to be.']}, {'question': 'What does Dash remind us about social networks?', 'answers': ["We've just forgotten a bit", 'how the Internet was supposed to work.']}]}
{'text': '(CNN) -- A former government contract employee was indicted on charges of stealing restricted nuclear energy-related materials and putting the United States at risk, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.\n\nSources say the classified materials were taken from the East Tennessee Technology Park.\n\nRoy Lynn Oakley, 67, of Roane County, Tennessee, appeared in federal court in Knoxville on Thursday.\n\nOakley was briefly detained for questioning in the case in January, when authorities first learned of the alleged plot to divulge the materials, government sources told CNN. He voluntarily surrendered Thursday at an FBI field office in Knoxville, the sources said.\n\nOakley is a former employee of Bechtel Jacobs, the Department of Energy\'s prime environmental management contractor at the East Tennessee Technology Park, prosecutors said.\n\nThe indictment states that Oakley, "having possession of, access to and having been entrusted with sections of \'barriers\' and associated hardware used for uranium enrichment through the process of gaseous diffusion ... having reason to believe that such data would be utilized to injure the United States and secure an advantage to a foreign nation, did communicate, transmit and disclose such data to another person."\n\nThe transfer took place January 26, the indictment alleges. Oakley is also charged with converting the material and "restricted data" to his own use. He began doing so on about October 17, 2006, and continued through January, prosecutors said.\n\nProsecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them.\n\nOakley\'s attorney, Herb Moncier, said outside court Thursday that Oakley\'s job was to break rods "into little pieces" and throw them away. Moncier said Oakley had a security clearance, but Moncier did not believe it was a high-level clearance.\n\nThe government alleges that in January, Oakley attempted to sell the "pieces of scrap" to someone he thought was a French agent -- but in reality was an undercover FBI agent, Moncier said. He said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an "appliance" under the law.\n\n"Mr. Oakley has cooperated fully for the last six months," said Moncier, who added that he had traveled to Washington for work on the case.\n\nEach count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\n"While none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization, the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands," Kenneth Wainstein, assistant attorney general for national security, said in the Justice Department statement.\n\nOne government source said the materials involved are not the "crown jewels," but they should not have been taken from the facility.\n\nA "barrier" is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process, according to nuclear energy officials, but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job.\n\nSources told CNN that federal authorities have been following Oakley and investigating the case for at least six months, after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material.\n\nOakley, described as a low-level employee, apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind, an official familiar with the case said.\n\nA government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of Oakley\'s alleged intentions six months ago, the FBI and Department of Energy launched a joint investigation.\n\nThe FBI then developed a sting operation, government officials familiar with the case said, and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country.\n\nEast Tennessee Technology Park is an area of the DOE\'s Oak Ridge reservation "where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985," Gerald Boyd, manager of the DOE\'s Oak Ridge site office, said Thursday. "When they were in use, now over 20 years ago, some of the buildings at ETTP housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium."\n\nBoyd said the technology park and the reservation "are protected by multiple layers of security systems and detection programs, both visible and unseen, meant to identify rogue employees attempting to abuse their access and position."\n\nIn this case, a review of security procedures showed that the system worked and "successfully identified the individual in question," he said.

{'text': 'LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Fans wishing to attend singer Michael Jackson\'s memorial service next week will have to register for the 11,000 free tickets, organizers said Thursday.\n\n\n\nMichael Jackson is shown rehearsing at the Staples Center on June 23, two days before his death.\n\n\n\nDetails on how to register for the 10 a.m. (1 p.m. ET) service at the 20,000-seat Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, Tuesday are to be announced Friday.\n\n\n\nJackson\'s family will hold a private ceremony before the public memorial service, his brother said Thursday.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to CNN\'s Larry King, Jermaine Jackson said the ceremony will be held Tuesday morning, but he did not say where.\n\n\n\nJackson rehearsed at Staples Center two nights before he died, and he appeared healthy in a video clip of the rehearsal obtained by CNN. Jackson died June 25 after collapsing at his rented home in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nAEG, promoter of Jackson\'s planned London, England, shows, released the short video of Jackson rehearsing in the arena on June 23.\n\n\n\nJackson sang "They Don\'t Care About Us," a song from his "HIStory" album, as he danced along with eight male dancers.  Watch Jackson rehearse »\n\n\n\nJackson did not specify where he wished to be buried in a 2002 will, which was filed in court Wednesday.  Watch CNN\'s Anderson Cooper talk about his interview with AEG »\n\n\n\nMore information emerged Thursday about how Jackson\'s estate will be shared, which his will estimated in 2002 as being worth $500 million.\n\n\n\nThe family trust created by Jackson to receive all of his assets includes his mother, his children and a list of charities, according to a person with direct knowledge of the contents of the trust.\n\n\n\nMother Katherine Jackson\'s 40 percent share would go to Michael Jackson\'s three children after her death, the source said.\n\n\n\nThe children -- ages 7, 11 and 12 -- also will share 40 percent of the estate\'s assets, and the remaining 20 percent will benefit charities designated by the executors of the will, the source said.\n\n\n\nA judge has delayed for a week, until July 13, a hearing to decide whether Katherine Jackson will remain the temporary guardian of Jackson\'s children.\n\n\n\nAt a brief talk with reporters Thursday, an attorney for Jackson\'s ex-wife Debbie Rowe said she "has not reached a final decision" on whether she will challenge Jackson\'s mother for custody of Jackson\'s two oldest children, according to her lawyer.\n\n\n\nA Los Angeles TV station quoted Rowe on Thursday morning saying, "I want my children."\n\n\n\nExcept for the statement to the radio station, she has not publicly indicated whether she would seek custody now that Jackson is dead.\n\n\n\nRowe was left out of the will.\n\n\n\n"I have intentionally omitted to provide for my former wife, Deborah Rowe Jackson," the will said.\n\n\n\nThe will nominated Katherine Jackson, now 79, as the guardian of his children. If Katherine Jackson were to die, "I nominate Diana Ross as guardian," Jackson said in the will, written July 7, 2002.\n\n\n\nSinger Ross, 65, was a lifelong friend of Jackson\'s.  Watch how the two had a close relationship »\n\n\n\nThere\'s also a question on when the will\'s executors should take over control of the late entertainer\'s assets, which Judge Mitchell Beckloff temporarily placed under Katherine Jackson\'s control.\n\n\n\nOne man named as executor is John Branca, who represented Jackson from 1980 until 2006 and was hired again before the singer\'s death. He helped acquire Jackson\'s music catalog, which is worth millions.\n\n\n\nThe other is music industry executive John McClain, a longtime Jackson friend who has worked with him and his sister Janet.\n\n\n\nDEA reportedly joins investigation\n\n\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration has joined the investigation into Jackson\'s death, a federal law enforcement official said Wednesday night.\n\n\n\nAnd the California State Attorney General\'s office said Thursday that it is helping the Los Angeles Police Department in its investigation. The attorney general\'s office said it will assist police in sifting through information in a state database that monitors controlled medication.\n\n\n\nTwo law enforcement officials separately confirmed the DEA inquiry, saying agents would look at doctors involved with Jackson, their practices and their possible sources of medicine supply.\n\n\n\nNeither official wanted to be identified because they could not comment publicly on the matter.\n\n\n\nOfficially, a DEA spokeswoman referred questions to the Los Angeles Police Department, which would not confirm the involvement.\n\n\n\n"We routinely offer assistance to any agency regarding the Federal Controlled Substance Act," said Sarah Pullen of the DEA. "However, at this time, we have nothing further to comment about the death of Michael Jackson."\n\n\n\nSpeculation about the role of drugs has been swirling since Jackson died June 25 at his rented estate in Holmby Hills. The cause of his death, at age 50, was pending toxicology results.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, police released a car belonging to Jackson\'s cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray. They had impounded the vehicle Friday, saying it might contain evidence -- possibly prescription medications.\n\n\n\nPolice did not say whether they found anything.\n\n\n\nMurray\'s attorneys issued a statement, asking the public to reserve judgment about the cause of death until the coroner\'s tests are complete.\n\n\n\n"Based on our agreement with Los Angeles investigators, we are waiting on real information to come from viable sources like the Los Angeles medical examiner\'s office about the death of Michael Jackson," the statement said. "We will not be responding to rumors and innuendo."\n\n\n\nNo public showing planned for Neverland\n\n\n\nLogistical and financial challenges derailed earlier plans for a public viewing and private memorial at Neverland Ranch.\n\n\n\nPlanning had been under way for a motorcade to carry Jackson\'s body from Los Angeles to the Santa Barbara County ranch, which state and local officials suggested would be difficult and costly.\n\n\n\nLaw enforcement sources had said a public viewing at the ranch was under consideration for Friday, but a spokesman for the family said that it would not happen.\n\n\n\n"Plans are under way regarding a public memorial for Michael Jackson, and we will announce those plans shortly," said Ken Sunshine, whose public relations firm had been hired by the Jackson family.\n\n\n\nDespite the announcement, more than two dozen TV satellite trucks lined the narrow two-lane road leading to the ranch.\n\n\n\nFor a time, the California Highway Patrol closed the road to clear up a small bottleneck of cars created by Jackson fans and the media.\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Drew Griffin, Kathleen Johnston, Michael Carey, Paul Vercammen, Carol Cratty and Kara Finnstrom contributed to this report.', 'questions': [{'question': "Who has  joined inquiry into Jackson's death?", 'answers': ['family', 'The Drug Enforcement Administration']}, {'question': 'Where will the memorial take place?', 'answers': ['at Neverland Ranch.', 'Staples Center in Los Angeles, California,', 'Neverland Ranch.', 'the']}, {'question': "How many days before Jackson's death was the video taken?", 'answers': ['his', 'two nights', 'he died,', 'two']}, {'question': "Where will Jackon's memorial be?", 'answers': ['Los Angeles, California,', 'Staples Center', 'Staples Center in Los Angeles,']}, {'question': "Who joins the inquiry into Jackson's death?", 'answers': ['look at doctors involved with', 'The Drug Enforcement Administration']}, {'question': 'How many service tickets will be made available?', 'answers': ['20,000-seat', '11,000']}, {'question': 'How many memorial service tickets will be made available?', 'answers': ['11,000']}, {'question': 'Whose memorial will be Tuesday?', 'answers': ["Michael Jackson's"]}]}

{'text': '(CNN) -- Henry Joseph Madden was a good student and track team member in high school, but he had a secret: He sometimes wore his mother\'s pantyhose and underwear under his clothes.\n\n\n\nDr. Jennifer Madden, a family physician, began her transition to being female at age 48.\n\n\n\n"I really wanted to be a girl so bad, and that was one way for me to satisfy those feelings," Madden said. "I always felt like someone was looking over my shoulder."\n\n\n\nThe desire to be female never went away. At age 48, Madden confessed these feelings to a doctor, and started seeing a gender therapist who suggested Madden was transgendered.\n\n\n\nThrough reconstructive surgeries, electrolysis, laser procedures and voice lessons, Henry Joseph became Jennifer Elizabeth, known as Jenny. She is a practicing family physician in Nashua, New Hampshire.  Watch Jenny\'s story »\n\n\n\nChastity Bono, child of performer Cher and the late entertainer and politician Sonny Bono, announced Thursday the beginning of a transition from female to a male.\n\n\n\nWhile still relatively rare -- one advocate estimates that 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the American population is transgendered -- the idea of changing gender identity has become more widespread in recent years. The term "LGBT" (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) is more commonly recognized, and transgendered people have been portrayed in the 1999 film "Boys Don\'t Cry" as well as the 2002 book "Middlesex" by Jeffrey Eugenides.\n\n\n\nMany people who have transitioned, including Madden, say they knew they had been born into the wrong gender from childhood. As early as age 3, Dr. Julie Praus, born male, didn\'t understand why her father wanted to play catch. As a boy, Praus learned how to fish and hunt, but enjoyed collecting Depression-era glassware vases. Praus, 48, a psychiatrist in Brattleboro, Vermont, started living as a woman in March 2008.\n\n\n\n"I get up every morning and say, \'Wow, I can actually look at myself in the mirror,\' because I\'ve never been able to do that in my life, because what would stare back at me was not me," Praus said. iReport.com: Share your story of gender change\n\n\n\nDoctors speculate that there is a biological foundation to gender identity, but no one has determined what in the biological makeup determines that gender. The interactions between personality and culture also contribute to identity, said Chris Kraft, clinical director at the Johns Hopkins Sexual Behaviors Consultation Unit.\n\n\n\nThe process of changing genders\n\n\n\nFor people who want a gender change on a biological level, the first step is therapy, experts say. Dr. Gary Alter, a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, California, said patients don\'t come to him until they\'ve been in therapy, a process that can take as much as a year.\n\n\n\nA therapist then gives a physician approval to start the patient on hormone treatment. At that point, the patient may or may not start living as the chosen sex, Alter said.\n\n\n\nFemales seeking to transition into males may elect to have their breasts removed via surgery. With testosterone, they will grow hair on their face and chest after about two years. Read one man\'s female-to-male advice to Chaz Bono\n\n\n\nA higher percentage of males transitioning to females will go forward with genital surgery than females going to males, Alter said. Surgical methods for creating a penis -- which range from making one out of the clitoris to using the skin from the forearms -- are "not perfect," and many patients are happy with just chest surgery, he said.\n\n\n\nGenital surgeries for creating female genitalia are better, he said. Alter\'s method is to make a clitoris out of the head of the penis, and make space for a vagina.\n\n\n\nFacing the rest of the world\n\n\n\nIt is rare for people to undergo a gender transition and then want to reverse it, especially when surgery is involved, experts say.\n\n\n\nSome say changing genders is one of the best things they\'ve done, like Jamison Green, 60, author of "Becoming a Visible Man," who went through chest reconstruction and genital surgery.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t have too hard of a time telling people about it," Green said. "I worried about that a lot in the beginning, before there was any kind of community and support about this condition, but one of the things I learned early on was that living in fear and shame is not very healthy."\n\n\n\nGreen, who started his transition at age 40, is now happily married to a woman whom he did not know before his change. Praus is also married to a woman, who knew her before her transition. Madden has a boyfriend.\n\n\n\n"For the longest time, I really felt like I had a mental illness, and I don\'t feel that way anymore," Madden said.\n\n\n\nBut all three have experienced shock and dismay from others around them. Green said his mother took five years to adjust. One of Praus\' sons doesn\'t speak to her. Madden\'s marriage to a woman ended in divorce during her transition, and her children have struggled.\n\n\n\nYet these three transgendered individuals say they feel better in many ways in their chosen gender roles.\n\n\n\n"My patients say I\'m a better doctor," Praus said. "Some of it is that I\'m not exerting so much energy hiding myself."\n\n\n\nPsychologists recommend that people who change genders adopt a "transgendered identity," and not keep their history of transition a secret. But some who "pass" as their new genders don\'t want to risk stigma, and tell only people closest to them, Kraft said.\n\n\n\nOften, males who transition to females face more problems than females who become males, Kraft said. Transgendered individuals who start as men tend to face more stigma, particularly if they are more noticeably transgendered.\n\n\n\nTransgendered individuals do face some legal quandaries. Some states require people to show proof of a medical procedure before changing gender on documents such as driver\'s licenses, while others require that the person has taken hormones, Kraft said. People may also elect to change their birth certificates to reflect chosen gender.\n\n\n\nChastity Bono, who now goes by "Chaz," has been a prominent gay-rights activist.\n\n\n\n"You could speculate that that could make it more complicated -- when you\'re a public figure -- to take on something stigmatizing" such as a gender transition, Kraft said.', 'questions': [{'question': 'What do doctors speculate?', 'answers': ['that there is a biological foundation to gender identity, but no one has determined', 'in the biological makeup determines that gender.', 'that there is a biological foundation to gender identity,']}, {'question': 'What do people rarely undergo?', 'answers': ['a gender transition and then want to reverse it,', 'rare for', 'to', 'a gender transition and then want to reverse it, especially when surgery is involved,']}, {'question': 'What is the estimated percentage of transgendered Americans?', 'answers': ['0.25 to 0.5 percent of the', 'population is', '0.25 to 0.5 percent']}, {'question': 'What is the percentage of transgender Americans?', 'answers': ['0.25 to 0.5 percent']}, {'question': 'What types of people would want to reverse a gender-reassignment surgery?', 'answers': ['Transgendered individuals']}, {'question': 'What do doctors speculate as the reason for gender identity?', 'answers': ['biological foundation to', 'there is a biological foundation to']}, {'question': 'What surgery do people undergo and then rarely want to reverse?', 'answers': ['gender transition']}, {'question': 'What proportion of the American population is transgendered?', 'answers': ['estimates that 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the', 'one advocate estimates that 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the', 'is', '0.25 to 0.5 percent']}, {'question': 'Biological foundation is an influence to what?', 'answers': ['gender identity,']}]}

{'text': 'LONDON, England (CNN) -- Scientists in the United States are developing a "synthetic tree" capable of collecting carbon around 1,000 times faster than the real thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nA conceptual design of how the "synthetic tree" might look should they ever reach the stage of production.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the wind blows though plastic "leaves," the carbon is trapped in a chamber, compressed and stored as liquid carbon dioxide.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technology is similar to that used to capture carbon from flue stacks at coal-fired power plants, but the difference is that the "synthetic tree" can catch carbon anytime, anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Half of your emissions come from small, distributed sources where collection at the site is either impossible or impractical," said Professor Klaus Lackner, Ewing-Worzel Professor of Geophysics in the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia University.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We aim for applications like gasoline in cars or jet fuel in airplanes. We are going after CO2 that otherwise is nearly impossible to collect," he told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the idea of carbon-catchers may sound far-fetched, an early model has been built and Lackner is in the process of writing a proposal for consideration by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe personally explained the concept in a 45-minute meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu last month at a three-day symposium on climate change in London.\n\n\n\n\n\n"He was there and I was there and he showed interest," Lackner told CNN. "That\'s exciting, but I don\'t particularly want to discuss this in a public forum because I think this gives me a little bit of an opportunity to tailor my proposals to the Department of Energy in a way that makes them more palatable."\n\n\n\n\n\nLackner started working on the concept of an ambient carbon catcher in 1998. "I argued back then and I still argue that the reason this can be done, from a theoretical point of view, is that the CO2 in the air is actually surprisingly concentrated, therefore the device you need to collect CO2 is quite small."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe "synthetic tree" looks more like a public convenience block than a hi-tech method of reducing carbon emissions, but Lackner told CNN it is highly efficient for its size when compared, for example, to a modern power-generating wind turbine.\n\n\n\n\n\n"If you give me one of those big windmills which have those big areas through which the rotor moves -- how much CO2 can I avoid? And if I had an equally sized CO2 collector -- how much CO2 can I collect? It turns out the collector is several hundred times better than the windmill."\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the "synthetic tree" an interesting alternative, or a  scientific flight of fancy that\'s unlikely to happen? Sound Off below.\n\n\n\n\n\nLackner told CNN that initial concerns over the cost of the technology were focused on the "front-end" carbon collector, including the sorbent used to catch the carbon dioxide in the air.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut after years of research, Lackner told CNN he and his colleagues have developed a sorbent that is "close to the ideal," in that it uses a relatively small amount of energy to release the CO2 and is not prohibitively expensive.\n\n\n\n\n\n"By the time we make liquid CO2 we have spent approximately 50 kilojoules [of electricity] per mole of CO2." Compare that, Lackner said, to the average power plant in the U.S. which produces one mole of CO2 with every 230 kilojoules of electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\n"In other words, if we simply plugged our device in to the power grid to satisfy its energy needs, for every roughly 1000 kilograms [of carbon dioxide] we collected we would re-emit 200, so 800 we can chalk up as having been successful," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLackner told CNN the biggest cost was at the "back-end" of the collector, primarily the technology used to release the CO2 from the sorbent.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said for that reason, on a cost-basis, the "synthetic tree" could not compete with modern coal-fired power plants that are designed to release fewer carbon emissions than their older predecessors. But he said when compared to the cost of retro-fitting an existing coal plant, the "synthetic tree" becomes more viable.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The bottom line is we have in this way the ability to deal with the problem at a cost which is somewhat higher than on a coal-fired power plant retro-fit, but not much higher."\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides, he said, the technology is not being developed as an alternative to the carbon capture and storage methods currently being tested for large-scale use on coal-fired power stations. He\'s targeting carbon that\'s already in the air.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of the "synethic tree" has caught the imagination of one of the first scientists to warn the world about global warming, Lackner\'s colleague at Columbia University, Newberry Professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Professor Wally Broecker.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I\'m extremely excited about this. I think this is something that the world\'s going to have to have, unfortunately," Broecker told CNN from Madrid where he received a BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award for his work on the issue of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nBroecker told CNN most people still don\'t recognize the magnitude of the task the world faces in reducing global carbon emissions, and it was likely that one day urgent action would need to be taken, above and beyond the current measures being discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We\'re probably not going to stop CO2 rising until it\'s double what it was near-1800 and maybe even more than that," he said. "I think we will find that the planet is too warm, ice is melting too fast... and we\'ll want to bring the CO2 back down again. The only way we can do that on a short timescale would be to pull it back out of the atmosphere."\n\n\n\n\n\nBroecker told CNN the units could stand in the middle of Australia, for example, and their presence wouldn\'t significantly disrupt the atmospheric distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Each unit would take out a ton of CO2 a day -- which would be the amount of CO2 produced by 20 average automobiles in the U.S.A.

{'text': 'COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lankan soldiers have seized a key rebel stronghold after launching a surprise attack early Sunday morning, the head of Sri Lanka\'s army announced.\n\nSri Lankan army chief Sarath Fonseka says a key Tamil town has been taken in a national TV broadcast Sunday.\n\nTroops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency.\n\n"Our troops fought their way through a 40 km (25 mile) thick jungle track," Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said in a televised address on Sunday.\n\n"This is the long awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years," the Sri Lanka Army chief said.\n\nThere is no confirmation from the rebels that the strategic garrison has been overtaken.\n\nThe Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country\'s ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead.\n\nThe rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government.\n\nIn recent days, the military has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds.\n\nEarlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula.\n\nIt had been in rebel hands for more than nine years.\n\nThe re-capture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea.\n\n"The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally," Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN. "They lost... about 90 percent of what they had."\n\nDespite major government gains, critics point to ongoing civilian casualties resultant from the conflict.\n\n"This is an important strategic success for the army, but literally tens of thousands of people, children, are in the line of fire," United Nations spokesman James Elder said in a phone conversation Sunday.\n\n"Some Sri Lankan U.N. staff are trapped there," he added. "Convoys are going to the area, delivering emergency supplies, but these are not sufficient for the number of people in need."\n\nSri Lankan authorities are barring journalists and humanitarian aid workers from areas where heavy fighting is taking place.\n\nAmnesty International spokesman Shuransu Mishra estimated that "over a quarter of a million of the population, mostly Tamils, are trapped between the two sides."\n\nThe organization says greater access and protection for aid workers and journalists are needed as news agencies struggle to report an accurate picture of the conflict.\n\n"The Sri Lankan authorities are doing little to ensure the safety of the country\'s media, or to prosecute those responsible for murdering or attacking them," Amnesty International spokeswoman Yolanda Foster said in a written statement on Friday.\n\n"They (Sri Lankan authorities) are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation," she said.\n\nAt least 14 journalists have been killed since the start of 2006, according to the statement.\n\nOthers have been driven from the country by death threats, or in fear of detention and torture by government authorities, it said.', 'questions': [{'question': 'When did rebels gain control?', 'answers': ['early Sunday morning,', '1996']}, {'question': 'Who wants independent homeland?', 'answers': ['Tamil Tigers', 'have fought for an', 'The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)', "for the country's ethnic Tamil", 'the Tamil Tigers', 'minority since 1983.']}, {'question': 'Who is making progress?', 'answers': ['the military', 'military']}, {'question': 'What did rebels gain control over?', 'answers': ['Mullaittivu in 1996 and established', 'military garrison there, according', 'Mullaittivu', 'the government.']}, {'question': 'When did they do this?', 'answers': ['early Sunday morning,']}, {'question': 'Who wants an independent homeland?', 'answers': ['Sarath Fonseka', 'Sri Lankan soldiers', 'Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam']}, {'question': 'Which northern town did troops regain control of?', 'answers': ['Elephant Pass,', 'Mullaittivu']}, {'question': 'What did they establish there?', 'answers': ['military garrison']}, {'question': 'Who gained control?', 'answers': ['Earlier this month, troops regained', 'Sri Lankan soldiers', 'The rebels', 'rebels']}]}
{'text': '(CNN) -- Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and members of the Sex Pistols have led tributes to the band\'s former manager Malcolm McLaren who died of cancer on Thursday aged 64.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs manager of the Sex Pistols and owner, with his then-lover Westwood, of the Sex boutique in London during the mid-1970s, McLaren was considered one of the pioneers of the punk movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n"When we were young and I fell in love with Malcolm, I thought he was beautiful and I still do," Vivienne Westwood said in a written statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nWestwood\'s son with McLaren, Joe Corre, her other son, Ben Westwood, and McLaren\'s girlfriend, Young Kim, were with him when he died in Switzerland after a battle with mesothelioma.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I thought he is a very charismatic, special and talented person. The thought of him dead is really something very sad," said Westwood.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lead singer of the Sex Pistols, John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten, also paid tribute to the band\'s former manager.\n\n\n\n\n\n"For me, Malc was always entertaining, and I hope you remember that," Lydon said. "Above all else, he was an entertainer, and I will miss him, and so should you."\n\n\n\n\n\nMcLaren and the Sex Pistols had a turbulent relationship during the band\'s brief, spectacular and controversial career.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally known as the Strand, McLaren drafted in Lydon as lead singer and renamed the band the Sex Pistols.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A thin girl with caramel skin and a yellow silk blouse walks alone through a barren landscape of rubble.\n\n\n\nNway prepares for her new job, selling vegetables from her aunt\'s garden.\n\n\n\nHer legs are marked by cuts. Her face is smeared with white streaks of powder. And her eyes are blank as she sifts through the debris of what used to be her home before Cyclone Nargis slammed into Myanmar one night and swept her parents away.\n\n\n\nHer name is Nway, and that\'s how she looked when aid workers found her after Nargis destroyed her isolated village. She refused to talk about the cyclone, pretending it never took place. She became, according to a CNN story, the "girl who refuses to remember."\n\n\n\nA year later, an aid worker returned to the village to see how Nway was doing. She found Nway living in a tidy, bamboo house flanked by palm trees. The 8-year-old greeted her visitor with a big smile. Then she asked whether she could play with her visitor\'s hair.\n\n\n\nPam Sitko, the aid worker, said Nway -- like thousands of people in Myanmar -- is slowly recovering one year after Nargis demolished their country.\n\n\n\n"After all of her pain and loss, she really is a spunky girl," said Sitko, who works with World Vision International, a humanitarian group. "She wasn\'t shy about reaching out to touch my blonde hair."\n\n\n\nThe night everything changed\n\n\n\nNway\'s resilience is shared by many in Myanmar, aid workers say.\n\n\n\nLast year\'s cyclone was catastrophic. It killed at least 140,000 people and left at least 2 million people without homes, according to the United Nations World Food Programme.\n\n\n\nThe brunt of the storm hit Myanmar\'s delta region, the country\'s bread basket. It wiped out crops, shrimp farms and fish ponds. A year later, many fields remain unplanted; supplies are short, and the lack of drinking water complicates recovery efforts, World Food Programme officials say.\n\n\n\nYet some sense of normal life is returning, said Mia Marina, a program support manager for World Vision\'s Nargis response efforts. World Vision is building cyclone-resistant schools and providing supplies to cyclone survivors.\n\n\n\n"Most of the people are going back to their livelihoods," Marina said. "Kids are going to school. The markets are open."\n\n\n\nThe people of Myanmar are also buying planting tools and seed in preparation for the monsoon rains that typically come in May, Sitko said.\n\n\n\n"Everyone is hoping that this is the moment that it turns around," Sitko said. "It\'s an exciting time, a time of hope."\n\n\n\nThat hope appears to have spread to Nway.\n\n\n\nShe is fortunate to be alive. The cyclone killed her mother and father. The winds were so powerful that they blew away the village buffalo. In Nway\'s village, 120 people out of a population of 430 people lost their lives.\n\n\n\nNway survived because she was staying with her aunt. The pair joined a group squeezed in to the village headman\'s house to survive, Sitko said.\n\n\n\nNway wouldn\'t talk about the cyclone after aid workers found her a month later. She would walk away whenever she was asked about that night. Now, according to Sitko, who wrote about her meeting for World Vision, Nway can talk a little about her loss.\n\n\n\nSitko said Nway shared one memory from the morning after the cyclone while sitting in her aunt\'s house:\n\n\n\n"When I walked to my aunt\'s house that day, my legs were scratched, and I passed lots of dead bodies," Nway said. "I wanted to help, because everyone was working, but I was too scared, so I only helped clean up my auntie\'s yard."\n\n\n\nNway dreams of her future\n\n\n\nNway prefers to talk about other subjects. One is her new job. She helps her aunt sell vegetables from their garden. On most mornings, she smears white powder made from tree bark on her cheeks (it\'s used as a skin beautifier by women and children in Myanmar). Then she balances a tray of vegetables on her head and walks to a village road to call out to potential customers.\n\n\n\nNway told Sitko that she\'s made "four new best friends." They like to memorize new words and play hide and seek after school.\n\n\n\n"I\'m always the fastest runner," she told Sitko.\n\n\n\nNway is starting to become aware of life outside her village.\n\n\n\n"She was very proud," Sitko said. "She explained that she had recently taken a trip to another village with her aunties, and she wasn\'t afraid."\n\n\n\nNway doesn\'t know, though, where she would attend school as she gets older, Sitko said. She\'ll have to pay to attend school away from her village one day, but her aunt and uncle can\'t afford the costs.\n\n\n\n"She wanted to study and said that she was smart," Sitko said. "She said she would be willing to travel to a school outside of her village if she had to."\n\n\n\nNway has already taken a more difficult journey.\n\n\n\nThe shocked girl who aid workers met a year ago has changed, Sitko said. Now Nway can remember -- and smile again.\n\n\n\n"I was expecting a very different girl," Sitko said. "The little girl I met was very confident.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Insurgents locked in a standoff with U.S. Marines tricked them by dressing up as women to escape, a task force spokesman said Monday.\n\n\n\nU.S. Marines scan the site of a blast that hit a U.S. vehicle in southern Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nWomen and children had been caught in the standoff between the armed groups, but some of the women were not what they seemed, according to task force spokesman Capt. William Pelletier.\n\n\n\nAfter the Marines began taking fire from insurgents in the town of Khan Neshin, in south Afghanistan near the Helmand River, the militants ran into a multiple-room compound, the U.S. military said.\n\n\n\nUnsure of whether civilians were inside the compound, the Marines had an interpreter talk to the insurgents, said an official who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly. After some time, a number of women and children left the compound, the military official said.\n\n\n\nThe released hostages told the Marines that there were no more civilians inside the compound, Pelletier said. But the Marines held their fire anyway, the official said. About 4 p.m. (7:30 a.m. ET), in the midst of the standoff, another group of women and children emerged from the compound, the official said. The Marines continued to hold their fire and wait out the insurgents, the official said.\n\n\n\nFinally, a screaming woman emerged from the compound with a bullet wound to her hand, Pelletier said. Then, another group of women came out, covered from head to toe according to custom, he said, with a couple of children in tow. The Marines attended to the wounded woman while the others walked away.\n\n\n\nWhen the Marines went into the compound, they discovered that it empty, Pelletier said.

The government takeover of Khan Neshin marks the first time coalition forces have had a sustained presence so far south in the Helmand River valley, the release said.\n\n\n\nThe mission to secure Khan Neshin coincides with "establishing secure conditions" for August elections in Afghanistan, according to the release.\n\n\n\nElsewhere in Afghanistan, a six U.S. soldiers were killed Monday by two roadside bombs, a representative for NATO forces said. Four were killed in Kunduz province in northern Afghanistan, the U.S. military said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Verizon has been touted as having the biggest, baddest, fastest 4G around. It\'s been this way since the carrier debuted its LTE network in late 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut now that AT&T has joined the LTE game, consumers looking for top speeds might consider turning their focus to AT&T instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf only for a while.\n\n\n\n\n\nMetrico Wireless, a firm that does network and mobile device analytics, took a look at 4G LTE service in the U.S., focusing on two of the nation\'s largest carriers, Verizon and AT&T.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company\'s latest report shows that AT&T\'s average LTE speeds are better than Verizon\'s (for now at least), and that LTE provides more than five times the performance of the carriers\' respective 3G offerings.\n\n\n\n\n\nMetrico used five 4G LTE handsets for its tests: two on AT&T, three on Verizon. On AT&T, the HTC Vivid and Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket were measured. The HTC Thunderbolt, Samsung Droid Charge and Motorola Droid Bionic were tested on Verizon\'s network.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn stationary download speeds, AT&T\'s 4G LTE handsets outperformed those on Verizon, but Metrico believes this disparity is likely due to the fact that Verizon\'s LTE service is more established and has significantly more subscribers using data on it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, as of April, Verizon had over half a million LTE subscribers. AT&T, meanwhile, just launched its LTE network in five markets this summer.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while AT&T\'s data speeds were better, web pages actually loaded faster on the three Verizon smartphones tested. "In general, the subscriber experience is not simply driven by the network or the device, but by the combination of the two," the report states.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Even devices with similar specifications connected to similar network technologies still demonstrate variation in performance."\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was especially true with regards to video performance. Of the smartphones tested, the Samsung Droid Charge (on Verizon) consistently yielded the highest frame delivery rate, while the Motorola Droid Bionic (also on Verizon) had the lowest.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, if you\'re really concerned about web page load times, consider this: All carrier-to-carrier comparisons notwithstanding, both AT&T and Verizon handsets delivered web page load times that were 80 to 85 percent shorter on LTE relative to 3G.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about battery life on an LTE device, notoriously reported as being poor? Well, depending on how you use your device, you may be able to squeeze out a few more hours, as the report found that battery life was heavily related to app use.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the AT&T Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket, you\'re going to get 300 to 350 minutes of use out of your device, whether you\'re a power user or someone who\'s making calls all day long.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the Verizon Droid Bionic, though, those who primarily use their phones for voice calling will gain about 150 minutes of usage over those who spend most of their time on Twitter and Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nVerizon\'s LTE network is currently the largest in terms of nationwide coverage, but AT&T\'s is set to rival it as it expands.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, indeed, we\'re finally beginning to see LTE infrastructure build-outs, industry-wide. Joining Metro PCS, Verizon and AT&T in the LTE game is Cricket Wireless, perhaps best known for its budget mobile phone and prepaid plan options.\n\n\n\n\n\nCricket will offer speeds up to 6 Mbps with a 5 GB data cap.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Coming back this weekend after a stay in Europe, I had that distinct sensation -- last felt when Lehman Brothers capsized, setting off the Great Recession -- that we once again find ourselves at the mercy of events and people just beyond our control.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere at home, one hears that by Wednesday dawn, we will know whether BP\'s latest big try to stop the oil spill will work. If it does, we can begin to feel that we are moving in the right direction, but if it doesn\'t -- well, no one is quite sure what Plan D looks like. Is this really where we have come: that the fate of our precious coastlines and the waters off our coasts are in the hands of a single foreign-based company?\n\n\n\n\n\nA month ago, it looked like the White House was on top of this problem, as Cabinet officers scurried here and there, the Coast Guard and others swung into action, there were talks with BP, and the president paid a personal visit. But increasingly, it has become apparent that the federal government may be present but is not in charge.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt keeps saying that BP bears ultimate responsibility. It is keeping the press away. No wonder James Carville, Chris Matthews and Donna Brazile exploded late last week. They are right on a basic point: Ultimately it is not the responsibility of BP or any other company to protect American interests but the responsibility of the federal government. Some Obama supporters have argued that the 1990 Oil Pollution Act limits the president\'s capacity to take action. Others disagree. Either way, in an emergency, laws can be changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough this disaster is not an existential threat, it could be argued that if the U.S. government had fought World War II in the same way it has fought the oil spill, we might well be speaking German now. Faced with a growing danger to our well-being, a WWII-type government would at minimum have:\n\n\n\n\n\n• Brought in the CEOs of all the major oil companies and charged them with the duty of an all-hands collaborative effort to stop the spill and help ward off the damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n• Brought in the best minds in the country, from universities and technology, for emergency efforts to find solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n• Moved quickly to mobilize the National Guard and other military forces, if necessary, ensuring that they received the resources needed to protect our beaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n• Made a clear call to citizen volunteers to help where necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n• Given Cabinet officers an ultimatum: Get this under control in the next 30 days, or else.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be ample time after this disaster for finger-pointing and blame-laying. The key now is to get this spill under control before it does far more damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Washington Post had it exactly right Monday morning when it argued that with the European crisis spreading now beyond Greece, "the knife-edge psychology currently governing global markets has put the future of the U.S. economic recovery in the hands of politicians in an assortment of European capitals."\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross Europe, one finds people stunned at the rapidity with which this crisis has grown, threatening not only their weak economies but also their dreams of a European utopia with people living a honeyed existence. All that could go smash now. Indeed, it is ironic that Europe may now be forced to give up its strong welfare state even as the U.S. is moving toward it. But the immediate point is that the U.S. finds itself too much at the mercy of whether European politicians and publics now make the right moves.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may take a while, but Americans are going to start feeling a lot happier about our country when we once again believe we have strong control of own destiny.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A California movement protesting $1 billion in budget cuts to the state\'s university system appeared to have burgeoned into a nationwide demonstration on Thursday.\n\n\n\nStudents and professors in dozens of states were challenging administrators and state lawmakers over budget cuts and tuition increases that they say are reducing students\' class options and increasing their expenses.\n\n\n\nSome of the demonstrations turned chaotic. In Oakland, California, police arrested 160 protesters who shut down a major freeway, according to city police spokeswoman April McFarland.\n\n\n\nThe Oakland protesters had left a march from the University of California, Berkeley to Oakland City Hall and wound up on the Interstate 980/880 interchange, CNN San Francisco affiliate KGO reported.

He fell from the tree onto the street below, a roughly 22 foot drop from the interchange, according to KGO.\n\n\n\nAt the University of California Davis, police held back student protesters who had threatened to shut down nearby Interstate 80, CNN affiliate KCRA in Sacramento reported.\n\n\n\nPolice fired rubber bullets into the ground in an effort to deter students, who made it as far as an I-80 exit ramp just south of campus.\n\n\n\nAt the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, at least 15 people were arrested in demonstrations Thursday, according to CNN affiliate WTMJ.\n\n\n\nA University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee vice chancellor allowed a protester to drop off pamphlets in the chancellor\'s office, then called campus police when dozens of protesters tried to enter the building, according to WTMJ.\n\n\n\nUniversity police called the Milwaukee Police Department for backup, and officers spent an hour rounding up protesters.\n\n\n\nStudents yelled "Let her go!" and "What did he do?" as Milwaukee police led students into their black and white vans.\n\n\n\nAcross the country, students told of having to work second jobs and make lifestyle adjustments in the face of dramatic tuition hikes.\n\n\n\n"I work at two jobs, go to school full time to make ends meet," said Tyler, a fifth-year senior at San Francisco State University, where students and faculty protested Thursday. She did not give her last name.\n\n\n\n"I have been here a really long time. I struggle to keep [taking] classes to be able to keep my financial aid every semester, and I really don\'t know when I\'m going to be able to get out of here. Every semester, something is cut, and I can\'t get the class I need. Who knows when I will be out of here," she said.\n\n\n\nMany of Thursday\'s demonstrations focused on cuts to state-funded colleges and universities, which supporters say drive up tuition, limit classes and make higher education unobtainable to many. A blog called Student Activism, which was compiling a list of the protests, said that 122 events were scheduled in 33 states -- most on campuses, and some at state capitols.\n\n\n\nAre you taking part in protests? Send photos, videos\n\n\n\nProfessors and students say dissatisfaction, anger and an uncertain future had led to call for a "Day of Action" to defend education.\n\n\n\nAt the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, dozens of protesters gathered Thursday and chanted, "Hey hey, ho ho, these student fees have got to go."\n\n\n\nVideo submitted from the demonstration by a CNN iReporter calling himself Bowtieguy showed students carrying handmade signs with messages like "Where\'s Holub\'s pay cut?" -- a reference to university chancellor Robert C. Holub.\n\n\n\nAnother homemade sign read "Chop from the top."\n\n\n\nAt California State University-Fullerton, dozens of students marched outdoors, chanting, "Students united will never be divided." A video submitted by a CNN iReporter who calls herself MelissaF showed handmade signs saying "Protect humanities" and "What happened to our future?"\n\n\n\nState funding for the California State University system was reduced by nearly $1 billion for the academic years between 2008 and 2010. Schools have responded by increasing fees, canceling classes, cutting student support programs and furloughing professors. Fees have increased 182 percent since 2002. Class waiting lists have doubled or tripled.\n\n\n\n"The less affordable education becomes, the less likely low-income students will be able to get a college education," said Lillian Taiz, president of the California Faculty Association and professor of history at California State University Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nIn addition to protests at numerous public colleges and universities in California, demonstrations also were planned for K-12 schools Thursday, according to the Student Activism blog.\n\n\n\nSee where the protests are happening\n\n\n\nOn the other side of the country, in Georgia, a legislative committee proposed $300 million in cuts to the state\'s college system, on top of the $100 million cut in the past two years, University of Georgia President Michael F. Adams wrote in an open letter to students, faculty and staff.\n\n\n\n"This is not our plan; these are not cuts we offered to make; and we will vigorously oppose any effort to implement them," Adams wrote.\n\n\n\nIn response, student organizers in Georgia are urging fellow students at every college in the state system to wear black this week to "symbolize the \'death\' of our education," according to a post on Facebook.\n\n\n\nIn Colorado, hundreds rallied at the Capitol in Denver, holding signs and cheering.\n\n\n\nWatch students march on Colorado Capitol\n\n\n\nIn New York, students at New York University, which is private, planned to meet up to protest tuition increases and education cuts with students from Hunter College and the New School, two other private institutions in Manhattan, said NYU student Claire Lewis.\n\n\n\n"It is a private university, but like a lot of public universities, our tuition is also getting increased," Lewis said. "This isn\'t anything new with the economic crisis with us; our tuition gets increased an average of 6 percent every year," she said.\n\n\n\n"But lots of our students depend on federally funded grants and loans, and so the broader-nation education cuts definitely affect us." She added, "Kids literally work two or three jobs to pay for their tuition here."\n\n\n\nIn Maryland, students at the University of Maryland in College Park planned to walk out of class at noon, meet at the student union and then march to a plaza for a rally, according to a Facebook invitation.\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Monica Trevino and Dan Simon contributed to this report.', 'questions': [{'question': 'how many reportedly arrested?', 'answers': ['160']}, {'question': 'who did they arrest', 'answers': ['shut down a major freeway,', 'police arrested 160 protesters']}, {'question': 'What did the protestors do?', 'answers': ['threaten to block interstate', 'brought Thursday evening rush hour traffic to a halt for an hour and 45 minutes.', 'shut down a major freeway,']}, {'question': 'in what University arrested?', 'answers': ['of California,']}, {'question': 'How many were arrest in the University of Wisonsin-Milwaukke demonstrations?', 'answers': ['15', 'at least 15 people', 'arrested', '15 people']}, {'question': 'what will raise tuition', 'answers': ['budget cuts']}, {'question': 'What have the duget cuts resulted in?', 'answers': ['nationwide demonstration', 'burgeoned into a nationwide demonstration', "reducing students' class options and increasing their expenses."]}, {'question': 'what reported police?', 'answers': ['San Francisco affiliate KGO']}]}
{'text': '(CNN) -- After meeting a number black couples in crisis, Nisa Muhammad and Dr. Rozario Slack were inspired to create Basic Training for Couples.\n\n\n\nNisa Muhammad, who founded National Black Marriage Day, co-created the Basic Training for Couples program.\n\n\n\nThe eight-week program educates dating, engaged or married couples about the value of commitment, responsibility to the black community, psychological differences between the sexes, sexual intimacy and conflict resolution.  Slack created the male-friendly portion while Muhammad, who founded National Black Marriage Day and the Wedded Bliss Foundation, created the female-friendly portion.\n\n\n\nIn the program, couples also learn about the history of the African-American marriage and many for the first time plot their own family tree to trace marriage and divorces.  The following is rundown of the eight-week course:  Class No. 1: Why marriage?\n\n\n\nThis class teaches the benefits of marriage for men, women, children and the community. It gives the history of marriage in the black community from slavery when marriage was illegal to today\'s trends.\n\n\n\nIcebreaker: Q & A: How couples met?\n\n\n\nHomework:\n\n\n\n1. Choose songs to reflect their love for each other\n\n\n\n2. Marriage family tree\n\n\n\nClass No. 2: From I to we; the sweetness of surrender\n\n\n\nThis class helps couples transition from "I thinking" to "we thinking." It helps them understand the value of making their marriage a priority in their lives.\n\n\n\nClass No. 3: Communication; getting your message understood\n\n\n\nThis class helps couples take responsibility for their communication and teaches skills to improve their communication techniques.\n\n\n\nMain lessons:\n\n\n\n• Respecting differences between men and women\n\n\n\n• Learning to talk to each other and not at each other\n\n\n\n• Format: Teaching session with dialogue.\n\n\n\n• Activity: The talking stick, during conversation only the individual holding the stick can speak.\n\n\n\nClass No. 4: Conflict management\n\n\n\nThis class helps couples understand that conflict needs to be managed, or it will manage you. It helps to normalize some conflict that couples experience with the understanding that some conflict cannot be resolved and can only be managed.\n\n\n\nLessons:\n\n\n\n• This class targets biases. When there\'s a difference of opinions, generally the stronger spouse wants his or her way.\n\n\n\n• How to bring closure to old issues instead of combining them into new issues/conflict.\n\n\n\n• Agree to disagree and not degrade your spouse for having a difference of opinion.\n\n\n\nActivity: Break up into gender groups to discuss current conflicts. The group works out ways to solve the issue\n\n\n\nClass No. 5: Let\'s make love\n\n\n\nWhen the sex is good in a marriage, it\'s only about 20 percent of what\'s going on. When it\'s bad, it\'s a significant problem. This class helps to solve some of those problems.\n\n\n\nThe approach was from a physiological and biological perspective of the differences between the male\'s and female\'s body. Discussion included chemical bonding effect in women and men.\n\n\n\nClass No. 6: From yours and mine to ours\n\n\n\nMany couples in the black community bring children from other relationships to their marriage. This class helps to blend the family into one cohesive unit. It also talks about preventing in-laws from becoming outlaws.\n\n\n\nClass No. 7: Keeping the FIRE burning\n\n\n\nFIRE is an acronym for Faithful, Intimacy, Responsibility and Excitement. This class helps couples maintain the FIRE in their relationship.\n\n\n\nClass No. 8: From this day forward\n\n\n\nThis class helps couples understand the value of commitment in their marriage and never to make divorce an option. They create their own place for success.\n\n\n\nRecap of all the lessons together:\n\n\n\n• Remembering people gravitate to the applause • Ways to appreciate and affirm your spouse • Setting time for just the two of you • Learning to communicate, getting your message heard and understood\n\n\n\nBonus class: Hot monogamy\n\n\n\nGets couples comfortable to discuss sex with their spouse.\n\n\n\nGraduation\n\n\n\nA ceremony of new beginnings, couples testify what the class brought to their marriage over the eight-week period. Lots of emotions and bonding during this time between husbands and wives.\n\n\n\nGraduating couples are encouraged to bring a couple from their community or family who needs help.', 'questions': [{'question': 'where is it held?', 'answers': ['Basic Training for Couples program.']}, {'question': 'What are the consequences of unhealthy relationships where children are concerned?', 'answers': ['from other', 'to their marriage.', 'bring']}, {'question': 'How many weeks is the program?', 'answers': ['eight-week']}, {'question': 'How long is the program?', 'answers': ['eight-week']}, {'question': 'Who created a program for couples?', 'answers': ['Dr. Rozario Slack', 'Nisa Muhammad and Dr. Rozario Slack', 'Nisa Muhammad']}, {'question': 'What is the program for?', 'answers': ['educates dating, engaged or married couples about the value of commitment, responsibility to the black community, psychological differences between the sexes, sexual intimacy and conflict resolution.', 'Couples', 'Basic Training', 'Couples.', 'eight-week']}]}

{'text': 'SAN MIGUEL DEL MONTE, Argentina (CNN) -- In a small farming town 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires, farmers are struggling to nourish their crops and feed their animals. The worst drought in half a century has turned Argentina\'s once-fertile soil to dust and pushed the country into a state of emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\nArgentine farmers profited in years past from selling beef to the world, but some now struggle to feed their cattle.\n\n\n\n\n\nCow carcasses litter the prairie fields and sun-scorched soy plants wither under the South American summer sun. Farmers are concerned about their livelihoods.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I\'m losing money. I can\'t afford to lose money all the time," said Juan Cahen D\'Anvers, whose family has been farming in Argentina since the late 1700s. He owns 700 hectares (1,730 acres) in San Miguel del Monte, where he grows sunflowers and barley.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says this year is one of the hardest he\'s ever had.  Watch farmer explain how hard he\'s been hit »\n\n\n\n\n\n"Production is going to go down a minimum of 50 percent, maybe more. I don\'t know yet," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nArgentina is one of the world\'s breadbaskets, providing commodities such as soy, wheat, corn and beef to countries around the globe. In recent years, record-high prices for these products reaped millions of dollars for Argentine farmers, but since the global economic crisis hit, demand and profits have dropped. Now the drought is making matters even worse.\n\n\n\n\n\nCesar Gioia, another San Miguel del Monte farmer, said time is growing short.\n\n\n\n\n\n"If it doesn\'t rain in the next 10 days, I will have to wipe out my entire corn crop, 90 hectares (220 acres)," he said. "The best I can do with it is feed it to my cows."\n\n\n\n\n\nFacing pressure from farmers, Argentina President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced emergency measures this week that will exempt the worst-hit farmers from paying most taxes for one year.\n\n\n\n\n\n"This is a big boost of patriotism, and a sign of support from all Argentines," Kirchner said on January 26. "All other sectors of the economy will continue to contribute, so we can help the farmers who have been affected by this drought."\n\n\n\n\n\nKirchner has had a contentious relationship with farmers, who staged noisy protests and strikes last year over an increase in export taxes. Those taxes eventually were reduced, but farming leaders still contend that the government is out of touch with their needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey say the measures announced this week fall short, and are demanding a cohesive, long-term plan for dealing with emergencies such as the current drought. If not, they say, they may strike again.  Watch how farmers reacted to Kirchner\'s move »\n\n\n\n\n\n"Sure, this plan is approved now, and it helps, but we need money to feed cows, to go back to planting crops, because this drought is impacting life in every sector of society," said Eduardo Buzzi of the Argentine Agrarian Federation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs she yanks dead soy plant vines from a dusty field in San Miguel del Monte, Lorena del Rios of the Argentina Rural Society says she expects the drought to affect both Argentine and overseas consumers, especially when it comes to Argentina\'s world-famous beef.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We will see less meat available, which means rising prices," she said.

{'text': '(Entertainment Weekly) -- How are the elements of the charming, traditional romantic comedy "The Proposal" like the checklist of a charming, traditional bride? Let me count the ways ...\n\n\n\nRyan Reynolds wonders if marrying his boss, Sandra Bullock, is a good thing in "The Proposal."\n\n\n\nSomething old: The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other -- until they realize they love each other -- is proudly square, in the tradition of rom-coms from the 1940s and \'50s. Or is it straight out of Shakespeare\'s 1590s?\n\n\n\nSandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get ... loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual.\n\n\n\nAnd there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret\'s fatal flaw -- she\'s Canadian. (So is "X-Men\'s" Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.)\n\n\n\nMargaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It\'s an offer the underling can\'t refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie\'s mood.)\n\n\n\nOK, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be\'s family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue.\n\n\n\nSomething new: The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s, Bullock has finessed her dewy America\'s Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature, pearly texture; she\'s lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos, and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe.\n\n\n\nReynolds, meanwhile, is just refining his dry comedy thing, learning to get the most from his deceptive cute-face looks.\n\n\n\nWho knew these two would, hmmm, complete each other? Working together, both are surer and more disciplined in delivering their comedy goods. iReport.com: "Proposal" has "plenty of laughs"\n\n\n\nSomething borrowed: The boisterous family dynamics. The eccentric supporting players (none more extreme than Oscar Nunez from "The Office"). The snappy screwball dialogue in Pete Chiarelli\'s script. And the way Anne Fletcher directs like a camp counselor wrangling bunkmates ... it\'s all been seen before. For a reason. These elements work.\n\n\n\nSomething blue: As the wise and saucy matriarch of the family, the divine 87-year-old Betty White has fun as one hot grandma -- and inspires her younger stars to say "I do," too.\n\n\n\nEW Grade: B+\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly', 'questions': [{'question': 'EW: "The Proposal" is a top-notch what?', 'answers': ['romantic comedy']}, {'question': 'What is a top-notch romantic comedy?', 'answers': ['"The Proposal"']}, {'question': "What adheres to formula, but it's well done, very funny ?", 'answers': ['"The Proposal"']}, {'question': 'What does the movie adhere to?', 'answers': ['rom-coms', 'the charming, traditional romantic comedy']}, {'question': 'The movie adheres to what?', 'answers': ['traditional romantic comedy', 'checklist of a charming, traditional bride?']}]}

It is available to all Comcast customers, so long as they subscribe to both Internet and Cable service.\n\n\n\nHeard said he doesn\'t expect to give up Hulu, though many of the same episodes and Web clips will be available on Fancast.\n\n\n\nHeard, trying out the site Tuesday after it went live, tweeted that he thought the service was "awesome," and he finally had a place where he could watch the entire series of "The Sopranos."\n\n\n\n"The quality, it\'s really clear and loads fast," he said, though he noted there were still some bugs in the product.\n\n\n\nHeard occasionally had to reload the site, and felt that installing the video player and authorizing the computer took a bit more time and was harder than simply pressing play on Hulu.\n\n\n\nThe service is getting mixed reviews on Twitter, with customers giving instant feedback about their experiences.\n\n\n\nSome complained that high-definition videos, which are available on Hulu, are not available on Comcast\'s service. Others complained about having to download a separate video player, the service not being compatible with the Linux operating system, and only being able to authorize the service on a total of three computers.\n\n\n\nComcast hopes to wow customers even more in the future.

Those not paying for HBO regularly, for example, won\'t be able to snag the newest episode of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" online.\n\n\n\nIn addition to catching up with sites like Hulu and Clicker, Comcast executives told media outlets they expect to serve up a feature that Tivo fans have come to love -- allowing customers to program their DVR from afar.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Israeli President Shimon Peres said he had an amicable phone conversation with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a day after Erdogan stormed offstage during an angry exchange with Peres at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTurkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan leaves the stage Thursday, as Israeli President Shimon Peres sits, left.\n\nPeres said he and Erdogan did not take the spat personally.\n\n"I called him up and said, yes, it\'s nothing against you, nothing against Turkey. We consider you as a friend," Peres said. He said Erdogan reciprocated.\n\nAlthough there was no mention of an apology, Peres said there was a polite exchange between the two leaders.\n\n"I didn\'t take it personally. I didn\'t go for a personal fight. I answered unfounded accusations. It was my duty. And they didn\'t change my mind," he said.  Watch Shimon Peres on the Gaza conflict Â»\n\nTurkey, a predominantly Muslim nation, has long been the Jewish state\'s closest military and economic partner in the region, and Turkey recently mediated indirect peace talks between Israel and Syria.\n\nBut many Turks have been incensed with Israel over its three-week military operation that ended there earlier this month.\n\nAnd in Davos, Erdogan was angered after Peres said that Israel is committed to peace and blamed Hamas for the fighting in Gaza, where Israel staged a three-week military operation that ended earlier this month.\n\nWhen Erdogan began responding, a moderator cut him off, saying the debate had run over its allotted time. Erdogan patted the moderator on the arm until he was granted one more minute to respond.  Watch commentary on Erdogan\'s angry exchange Â»\n\n"I know the reason behind raising your voice is because of the guilty psychology," he said to Peres. "My voice will not be that loud. You must know that. When it comes to killing -- you know killing very well. I know how you hit, kill children on the beaches."\n\nHe then left the stage, complaining that Peres was receiving preferential treatment.\n\n"From now on, Davos is finished for me," Erdogan said. "I will not come back. You won\'t let people talk. You gave him 25 minutes, but you gave me 12 minutes. This is not right."\n\nErdogan had described the military campaign against Hamas fighters in Gaza as "barbaric" and accused Israel of using excessive force.\n\nHe said: "The Palestinian Territories are like an open-air prison, isolated from the world. I have always been a leader who said anti-Semitism is a crime against humanity. But so is anti-Islamism."\n\nPeres had said Hamas was responsible for the "tragedy," accusing the Islamist militants of creating a "dangerous dictatorship."\n\n"Israel left Gaza completely -- no occupation," Peres said. "I want to understand why they throw rockets at us."\n\nOn Friday, after his outburst, Erdogan returned home to a hero\'s welcome.

{'text': "(CNN) -- Arsenal climbed to the top of the English Premier League with a 2-0 victory over London rivals West Ham despite playing half of Saturday's clash with only 10 men.\n\n\n\n\n\nArsene Wenger's team moved a point above champions Manchester United, who host Liverpool on Sunday, while Chelsea dropped to third ahead of their trip to Blackburn. Carlo Ancelotti's side can join Arsenal on 67 points with victory in that game.\n\n\n\n\n\nGianfranco Zola's West Ham team were left to rue a missed penalty as the defeat left them just three points above the relegation zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nArsenal, who on Friday were handed a chance to avenge 2006's Champions League final defeat by Barcelona in the upcoming quarterfinals, took the lead after just five minutes in the rain at the Emirates Stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazil midfielder Denilson fired in a low shot for his sixth goal this season, having dispossessed Valon Behrami and then played a neat one-two on the edge of the area with striker Nicklas Bendtner.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Arsenal could not turn their dominance into further goals, and West Ham should have leveled just before halftime when Belgium defender Thomas Vermaelen was sent off as his nudge in the back of Guillermo Franco saw the Mexico striker tumble in the box.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Alessandro Diamanti saw his penalty saved by Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, and the hosts also escaped in the second half when substitute striker Carlton Cole saw his fierce low shot hit the outside of the post.\n\n\n\n\n\nArsenal captain Cesc Fabregas made the points safe on his return from injury five minutes after that with a penalty on 82, as England defender Matthew Upson paid the price for deliberately blocking the Spain midfielder's clever little flick with his arm.\n\n\n\n\n\nTottenham consolidated fourth place with a hard-fought 2-1 victory at 10-man Stoke, as substitute Eidur Gudjohnsen came off the bench to put the London club ahead before Dean Whitehead was sent off and then helped set up Niko Kranjcar's 77th-minute winner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe on-loan Iceland forward netted just 18 seconds after halftime having come on for Roman Pavlyuchenko, who joined England striker Jermain Defoe on the injured list after suffering a hamstring problem in the first half.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitehead went three minutes later for his second booking, but Stoke leveled on 64 as winger Matthew Etherington scored from the penalty spot against his former club after fullback Benoit Assou-Ekotto fouled striker Paul Kitson.\n\n\n\n\n\nGudjohnsen's dummy allowed Croatia midfielder Kranjcar to put the Londoners four points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool, who will have played one more match after Sunday's trip to bitter North-West rivals United.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe victory was doubly important for Tottenham after fellow Champions League hopefuls Aston Villa had to come from behind to snatch a 2-2 draw with lowly Wolverhampton in the Midlands derby earlier on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Carew put Villa ahead in the 16th minute despite appearing to be offside, and the Norway striker salvaged a point for the hosts with eight minutes remaining as he steered Steve Sidwell's low shot into the visitors' net for his 13th league goal this season.\n\n\n\n\n\nWolves moved four points clear of the bottom three, but were denied a first win at Villa Park in 30 years despite Jody Craddock's bundled 23rd-minute equalizer and an own-goal from England international James Milner seven minutes before halftime.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result left Villa in seventh, having played one less game than Tottenham, equal on 50 points with Manchester City, who travel to Fulham on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nEverton moved above Birmingham into eighth place with a 2-0 win at home to Bolton, who had Gretar Steinsson sent off in the 71st minute for bringing down Nigeria striker Yakubu.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanish midfielder Mikel Arteta fired in the resulting freekick and South Africa international Steven Pienaar wrapped up victory with a minute to go after Leon Osman hit the crossbar.\n\n\n\n\n\nBirmingham crashed 3-1 at Sunderland, who eased their relegation worries as England World Cup hopeful Darren Bent scored twice in the first 11 minutes to take his Premier League tally to 20 goals this season and 21 overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nWigan moved seven points clear of the bottom three with a 1-0 win over Burnley, as Colombia striker Hugo Rodallega's 90th-minute header left the visitors deep in relegation trouble after a 15th defeat in 16 away matches.\n\n\n\n\n\nHull remain second from bottom, behind Burnley on goal difference, as new manager Iain Dowie suffered a heartbreaking 3-2 defeat at basement club Portsmouth in his match in charge.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visitors led 2-1 with 17 minutes to play after two goals from striker Caleb Folan, but Portsmouth's on-loan midfielder Jamie O'Hara leveled in the 88th minute with a curled free-kick and the Nigerian veteran Kanu netted a late winner.\n\n\n\n\n\nPortsmouth are still set to be relegated after being docked nine points for going into administration, now 14 points from

{'text': '(CNN) -- "It was booked as a Kids in the Hall tour, but the stages were too small."\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin McDonald explains -- as only he can -- his current U.S. comedy act with Scott Thompson. They\'re calling it "Two Kids, One Hall."\n\n\n\n\n\n"They could only fit two-and-a-half of us," he says, "So we fired two-and-a-half, and the other guy didn\'t want to come as a half. After some contract negotiation, it became Scott and I."\n\n\n\n\n\nLongtime fans of the legendary Canadian sketch comedy group know the full cast as also including Dave Foley, Bruce McCulloch and Mark McKinney. (McDonald didn\'t specify which of these three was asked to be half a man on the tour, but the smart money is on Foley.)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1989 to 1995, the Kids in the Hall enjoyed TV success, and many of their sketches and phrases have become a part of pop culture lore. For instance, if you\'ve ever crushed somebody\'s head, you, sir, have enjoyed a Kids in the Hall moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\'s plenty more from their catalog of absurdity, and you can pretty much find them all somewhere on the Interwebs. But if you\'re looking for a place to start, this author\'s personal favorite is a sketch called "Citizen Kane." And my friend Paul favors one called "Wrong Number." So, here, now, you have some Kids in the Hall advice from somebody named Paul, and somebody with the last name Bellini.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to touch us.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being known for their sketches, the current Scott Thompson/Kevin McDonald tour is actually more focused on stand-up comedy. Thompson says, "I never liked it until very recently. I always felt too exposed and out of control."\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\'s definitely something new for Thompson and McDonald, and, perhaps, even more new for their fans. But the chemistry between the two comedians comes out best when they share the stage during moments throughout the show. And it certainly came out when we sat down with them in Atlanta before their performances at The Punchline. As you\'ll see in our video, Thompson and McDonald feed off each other with ease, often completing each other\'s thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\nCertainly, like all comedy, the Kids in the Hall aren\'t for everyone, but there\'s no denying their success; especially if catching the eye of a young Uma Thurman is the barometer of that success.\n\n\n\n\n\nThompson recalls meeting her backstage after a show early in the group\'s career.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Uma Thurman at the time was the sexiest woman in the world," he says. "We had never met a celebrity before. We all thought she wanted to sleep with us. It really was a big launching pad for us. It made us think that wow, we\'re in the big leagues.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A 14-year-old Filipino-American boy abducted in July by suspected Islamic militants in the Philippines is free, officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Lunsmann was reunited with his mother, the U.S. Embassy in Manila said Monday, without offering additional details.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It was a tough time. It was a tough five months," Kevin\'s father, Heiko, told CNN affiliate WSET, from the family home in Lynchburg, Virginia. "I\'m just so happy."\n\n\n\n\n\nHeiko Lunsmann said the boy had plotted his escape for a while and eventually seized the opportunity some time late last week while his guards slept.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe "was spotted alone" Saturday about six miles southwest of Lamitan City on the island of Basilan, a stronghold of the Islamic militant group Abu Sayyaf, the official Philippines News Agency said.\n\n\n\n\n\nArmy officials turned him over to American forces in the southern Mindanao region, the Philippine government said in a statement to CNN affiliate TV 5.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Philippine Inquirer quoted the Lamitan city mayor, Roderick Furigay, as saying Kevin walked for two days, surviving on candies his captors presumably gave him and on coconuts that he retrieved by climbing trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n"In this holiday season nothing makes me happier than knowing that an innocent victim is returned to his family in time for holiday celebrations," Harry Thomas, the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, said in a weekend statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n"If ever we are to be inspired by the human spirit, we should take comfort in the courage, commitment and love that the Lunsmann family exhibited during this trying ordeal," Thomas added.\n\n\n\n\n\nFourteen gunmen snatched Kevin, his mother, Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann, and his 19-year-old cousin, Romnick Jakaria, in July while they vacationed on the island of Tictabon, authorities said. The abductors forced them to board awaiting boats, which then sped off in the direction of Basilan.\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin\'s mother was released by her captors in October. Jakaria was released last month, according to the news agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nBasilan serves as a base for Abu Sayyaf, which wants to establish a separate state for the Philippines\' minority Muslim population. The U.S. State Department considers the group a terrorist organization and says it is linked to al Qaeda. The Philippines government has been fighting to contain the militants.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbu Sayyaf has been blamed for several terrorist attacks in the Philippines, including the bombing of a ferry in 2004 that left about 130 people dead, as well as past kidnappings.\n\n\n\n\n\nBasilan\'s governor called on authorities Sunday to prosecute the alleged kidnappers of the Lunsmann family, according to the news agency.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The prosecution of kidnappers by a court of law will put a stop to kidnappings," the news agency quoted Jum Akbar as saying.\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas, the U.S. ambassador, said the crime will not go "unpunished."\n\n\n\n\n\nGerfa Lunsmann was adopted by Americans when she was 9 and grew up in Virginia. She eventually married a German citizen.

{'text': 'LONDON, England (CNN) -- While the Oscars is without doubt the grandest of all the awards ceremonies, it doesn\'t have the world stage to itself.\n\n\n\n"Persepolis" won the French nomination -- but failed to make the Academy\'s shortlist\n\n\n\nIn London, the Brits have their BAFTAs; Spain has the Goyas; and France celebrates the Cesars, where "La Vie En Rose" won six out of its "magnifique" 11 nominations. And it was this foreign fare that gave rise to the biggest controversy at Hollywood\'s big event.\n\n\n\n"La Vie En Rose" amassed an impressive eleven nominations at the French Cesar Awards. Marion Cotillard\'s astonishing transformation into Edith Piaf won her Best Actress gongs at the Golden Globes, BAFTAs and the Academy Awards. But "La Vie En Rose" was not among the contenders for Best Foreign Film.\n\n\n\nAnother French language film, "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly," was on many critics\' top ten lists for the films of 2007. It won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film and its American director Julian Schnabel was nominated for an Oscar. But like "La Vie En Rose," this film was not among the contenders for Best Foreign Film.\n\n\n\nA third French film, "Persepolis" won the special jury prize at Cannes and it received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature, but yet again, this was not a nominee for Best Foreign Film.\n\n\n\nFrance suffered through an abundance of riches this year, with three potential Oscar winners. But to enter the race for Best Foreign film, France, like every other country, had to nominate just one.\n\n\n\nSo "La Vie En Rose" and "Diving Bell" were rejected by the French film authorities in favor of "Persepolis." But "Persepolis" didn\'t sufficiently impress the Oscar judges: so France had no films among the final five nominees.\n\n\n\nFrench frustration at the Oscar process was echoed in Taiwan, which chose Ang Lee\'s film, "Lust Caution," as its official entry. The film won both critical acclaim and the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. But Oscar judges ruled there was too little Taiwanese involvement -- none of the lead actors are from Taiwan. The double Oscar winning director watched in disbelief as his film was banned and Taiwan was told to pick another film instead: Oscar caution triumphing over Ang Lee\'s lust for a third Academy Award.\n\n\n\nAnd the list goes on: the Israeli film, "The Band\'s Visit" was excluded for having too much English -- but it\'s the only way the Israeli and Egyptian protagonists can communicate in the film and is a key part of the plot. But Israel submitted "Beaufort" instead -- and made the final five.\n\n\n\n"The Kite Runner" may have proved an international success at the box office, but it didn\'t fly with Oscar watchdogs. Set in Afghanistan with Farsi as its main language, it fell foul of the rulebook by having too little Afghan involvement and a Swiss-American director.\n\n\n\nBut for most critics, the most inexplicable omission from the shortlist of nominees was Romania\'s "4 Months, 3 weeks & 2 Days," winner of the Palme D\'Or in Cannes and considered by many to be a sure-fire Oscar winner. Some feel its challenging subject of a back-street abortion in communist Romania was too testing for conservative members of the Academy\'s Foreign Film Committee, whose volunteers tend to include many retirees -- who else has time to attend screenings of 63 foreign language films?\n\n\n\nEven Marc Johnson, the Chairman of the Academy\'s Foreign Language Film Committee, acknowledged that some of the criticism levelled against the Academy this year was "justifiable".\n\n\n\nHe told CNN: "We took quite a beating, and I think quite justifiably, not for the films that we selected but for the films that we DIDN\'T select.\n\n\n\n"And I felt very passionately about it and spoke out about it more than I should have done, but there was a part of me saying "wait a minute I didn\'t sign on for this -- I didn\'t sign on to be the scapegoat and we received a lot of criticism and yet it\'s something I feel so passionately about I think foreign language film and particularly subtitled film in the U.S. are really an endangered species."\n\n\n\nDefenders of the Academy also point out that they\'re only asking countries to nominate their favorite film; they then pick the best of that bunch.\n\n\n\nMr Johnson said it would be unfair to allow countries to submit more than one film as the selection process would become "unmanageable".\n\n\n\n"There have been arguments that why can\'t a coutnry submit more films? France for instance might argue we make 50 films a year, maybe five of them are Oscar worthy and Ecuador maybe only makes one why is it we have the same group as they?" .\n\n\n\n"Not that I ever like to mix sports with the arts but it\'s a little bit like the World Cup. Brazil could probably submit five teams but they\'re only allowed to submit one -- and it\'s what makes it a fair race," he explains.\n\n\n\n"The other thing is quite frankly this year we had 63 films. We could not see many more than that. So if we had 5 from this country and 3 from this country it would be completely unmanageable."\n\n\n\nAnd while the one-film-per-country rule fails to reward a nation with a flourishing film industry, it does ensure diversity: no less than 63 countries from Azerbaijan to Vietnam submitted films for the 80th Academy Awards.\n\n\n\nIsrael, Austria, Poland, Russia, and Kazakhstan -- representing 210 million people in all -- were the countries vying for the prize on Oscar night, and the Academy points to the quality of those on the list, rather those that are not, as ultimate proof that the system works.

He was among several employees who told investigators they last saw Wiles on April 1, 2008, at the office and had no clue what happened to him.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FBI won\'t reveal the suspected motive or why agents believe it was Holt who left a uniquely signed ransom note demanding money two days after Wiles disappeared.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, agents said Wiles\' father tried to comply with the demand to get back his son, but heard nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHolt is described as an employee who, at least at one time, had a supervisory role at the company.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities say he now works as a contract employee doing similar flight maintenance work at Patrick Air Force base near Cape Canaveral in Florida.\n\n\n\n\n\nWiles was single. When he vanished without a trace, fellow employees said they were stunned.\n\n\n\n\n\n"All that he ever worked on was customer relations.

Dick Mackey\'s one-second win over Rick Swenson in 1978 set a record for the closest finish in Iditarod history.\n\n\n\nThe Iditarod, though, isn\'t a competitive sprint to the finish for every musher in the field. Jim Lanier, 69, of Chugiak, Alaska, mushes primarily for enjoyment. He\'s entered and completed 13 Iditarods, at least one in all four decades the race has been in existence. He has never won.\n\n\n\nRookie Iditarod musher Kristy Berington admits that she\'s not racing to win; she just hopes to finish. Her longest race prior to entering this year\'s Iditarod was only 300 miles.\n\n\n\n"I\'ve got puppies on this team that I want to see get to Nome. It\'s like watching your kid graduate from college," said the 25-year-old Kasilof, Alaska, resident. "They go and they\'re puppies, and they come back and they\'re dogs."\n\n\n\nShe has been training with Iditarod veteran Paul Gebhardt and has borrowed one of his dog teams to lead her to Nome.\n\n\n\nOutside of personal accomplishments and goals, the race this year also presents an opportunity for some mushers to show their respect to fallen serviceman, thanks to a collaboration with the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors.\n\n\n\nAlways a top competitor in the race, four-time Iditarod champion Martin Buser of Big Lake, Alaska, has six commemorative purple ribbons attached to his sled this year, placed there at the ceremonial start by the wives of the fallen soldiers and officers.\n\n\n\nBuser, who was born in Switzerland in 1958, became a U.S. citizen in 2002.\n\n\n\n"After the 9/11 incident, I proved to my boys that this is the soil I wanted to defend ... so being asked to do such honors as these are very, very important to me because I\'m truly one of the new immigrants and one of the staunches believers in our country," he said.\n\n\n\nBuser was naturalized under the famous burled arch in Nome at the finish line of the 2002 Iditarod. He carried an American flag in his sled for more than 1,000 miles to the finish line that year and set an Iditarod record for the shortest race time ever recorded: 8 days, 22 hours, 46 minutes and 2 seconds.\n\n\n\nHis two sons are even named after Iditarod checkpoints: Nikolai and Rohn.\n\n\n\nThe 2010 Iditarod musher\'s roster includes men and women ages 18 to 69 who hail from five countries: the United States, Canada, Scotland, Belgium and Jamaica. Some are professional mushers who raise and train sled dogs year-round; others are teachers, nurses, horse trainers, foresters or biologists. A doctor and a fishing guide also are included, among other professions.\n\n\n\nAsked to explain why mushers are drawn to this sport, four-time Iditarod champion Jeff King of Denali Park, Alaska, took time to reflect before answering.\n\n\n\n"Until you\'ve ridden a dog team you\'ve trained from puppies on a full moon with a hard trail and feel their energy and hear the panting of their tongues, the jingle of their collars, feel the surge of power that comes through the handlebar, I don\'t think you can appreciate what it\'s really like," the 54-year-old said.

{'text': '(CNN) -- William Beach was one of those people who fixated on certain foods. He would eat the same thing voraciously for a few days, and then, when he tired of the same tastes, he moved onto something else.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August, when summer\'s heat seemed unending in Mustang, Oklahoma, Beach took to savoring fried chicken -- and soft, sweet cantaloupe.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeach was elderly -- 87 -- but after eating the fruit, his health declined rather suddenly and before anyone in his family knew what was wrong, he was dead.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is among 15 people who died from Listeria monocytogenes in what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is calling the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998.\n\n\n\n\n\nGallery: The decade\'s 10 biggest food-borne illness outbreaks\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bacteria was traced to Rocky Ford cantaloupes grown at Jensen Farms\' fields in Granada, Colorado. As of Monday, the outbreak had affected people in 19 states.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CDC first reported it publicly on September 12, six days after William Beach\'s family buried him.\n\n\n\n\n\nListeria? What\'s that?\n\n\n\n\n\nBeach and his wife Monette bought the tainted cantaloupe at a Homeland grocery, where the store motto says: "the best is fresh."\n\n\n\n\n\nA week after he ate the fruit, Beach felt malaise, perhaps not unusual for a man of 87 years. But then his face turned the shade of a tomato. Soon he had trouble breathing and collapsed on the living room floor, according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed against Jensen Farms.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonette heard him struggling to pull himself up off the floor.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe hobbled into the room with her cane and saw her husband of 67 years unable to speak, unable to get up.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe dialed 911 and an ambulance whisked Beach to Baptist Hospital in nearby Oklahoma City. He was discharged the next day but when he got worse at home, he returned to the hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of Beach\'s six daughters, Brenda Hathaway met her father at the emergency room. Beach told her he didn\'t want Monette to see him this way.\n\n\n\n\n\nListeriosis causes fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. It is rarely a serious concern for healthy children and adults, according to the CDC, but it is particularly dangerous for pregnant women and the elderly or people with weakened immune systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the evening of September 1, medical staff tried to intubate Beach but he began hemorrhaging from the mouth and nose, the court documents said. Soon after, he died.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonette never saw her husband alive again. Two days after his funeral, an official from the Oklahoma State Department of Health called Hathaway.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was told then that her father had tested positive for Listeria.\n\n\n\n\n\nHathaway\'s sister Debbie Frederick said the family wondered why it took the hospital two days to release her father\'s body. They had assumed he died of natural causes.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We knew it was some sort of infection, but we did not know what it was," she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Listeria? She had never even heard that word before.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you need to know about Listeria\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth officials began questioning Beach\'s daughters. What had he eaten in the weeks prior? They specifically asked if he had consumed cantaloupes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrederick, meanwhile, glued herself to her computer, determined to learn more about the illness that killed her father.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Doing all that reading, it became patently clear that the health departments knew there was an issue," she said. "They knew there was a Listeria problem."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Beach family\'s angst led to a lawsuit filed against Jensen Farms. Frederick said she hopes the lawsuit will help strengthen food safety laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It\'s a terrible thing to lose someone you love to something that could be prevented," she said. "I pray that it\'s over. I hope nobody else has to lose a loved one."\n\n\n\n\n\nBattling the bacteria\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Littleton, Colorado, Jeni Exley\'s parents, Herbert and Elaine Stevens, were getting ready to celebrate 60 years of marriage on September 8.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey still had a good life together. Despite his age -- 84 -- he felt spry enough to take the dogs out for a walk in their Littleton neighborhood. He let Elaine do most of the grocery shopping and cooking but he could make his own sandwiches for lunch.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to keep your food safe\n\n\n\n\n\nIn early August, Elaine came home from the nearby King Soopers market with half a Jensen Farms cantaloupe. She didn\'t buy the whole thing -- it was only the two of them. Besides, she liked to able to see through the cellophane and decide if it was ripe enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe and Herbert both ate the lush fruit. Herbert started to feel sick, just like William Beach.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour days before Beach was rushed to hospital in Oklahama, Stevens couldn\'t get up from the toilet in Colorado. He had a fever of 103 degrees and felt nauseous.\n\n\n\n\n\nElaine called an ambulance which ferried her husband to Littleton Adventist Hospital. Unlike the Beach family, Stevens\' daughters learned after a few days that their father was infected with Listeria.\n\n\n\n\n\nExley, 55, like Frederick, went online to learn more about the bacteria that had sickened her father. Health officials, after questioning Elaine about what the couple had eaten in the last few weeks, determined that Herbert Stevens was a part of the latest outbreak.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter antibiotic therapy, Stevens was transferred to a nursing home. Exley arrived on her parents anniversary with chocolate milkshakes in hand. But her father wasn\'t feeling well. He was sent back to the hospital when his condition worsened.\n\n\n\n\n\nStevens eventually regained some of his strength. He was sent to a skilled nursing facility to recuperate on September 19, the same day that the Food and Drug Administration announced it had found Listeria monocytogenes in samples of Jensen Farms\' Rocky Ford cantaloupes.\n\n\n\n\n\nStevens\' Listeria is gone but at that age, he will probably never return to the man he was, Exley said. A little bit of him went with his bout with the bacteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe uses a walker now to move around; all his body functions seem affected, Exley said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I think it is amazing that he even survived," she said. "I am surprised he is not one of those people who died."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stevens are also suing Jensen Farms in hopes of recouping some of their medical costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nExley, who loves cantaloupe, feels extremely lucky her family escaped tragedy. She, too, had bought some of the tainted fruit and received an automated phone call at home warning her about the recall.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe, like Frederick, thought she could trust what she was buying at the neighborhood grocery store. From now on, she will think twice.

{'text': 'Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- After the Republicans and Democrats met at the White House summit on health care, it was clear that the parties are very far away from a bipartisan agreement. Indeed, few participants walked away with the sense that they were any closer to a deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House did make clear that it was willing to move forward on health care without Republican support. The choice now becomes whether Democrats should use the budget reconciliation process to pass some parts of health care legislation. According to recent reports, Democrats are considering having the House pass the bill that was already approved in the Senate and then dealing with a package of additional reforms through reconciliation.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrograms that are considered under the reconciliation process are not subject to a Senate filibuster. Democrats would only need 51 votes, not 60, to pass those parts of the bill that are included under reconciliation.\n\n\n\n\n\nReconciliation was created through the Budget Reform Act of 1974 in an effort to streamline the budget process, strengthen the ability of Congress to make tough decisions regarding deficits, and to make legislative decision-making more efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\nCongress quickly expanded on the types of measures that could be considered under reconciliation until 1985 and 1986, when the Senate passed rules proposed by Sen. Robert Byrd that limited what could or could not be included when using this process.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore moving forward, Democrats must consider two questions. The first is whether using reconciliation to pass health care is legitimate or an abuse of the process. Republicans have charged that this would be akin to forcing the program through the chamber rather than passing the bill through negotiation and compromise.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn this question, the answer is easy. Reconciliation has been as much a part of the Senate in the past three decades as the filibuster. According to an article that was published in The New Republic, Congress passed 22 reconciliation bills between 1980 and 2008. Many important policy changes were enacted through this process, including the Children\'s Health Insurance Program, COBRA (which allows people who switch jobs to keep their health care), student aid reform, expansions in Medicaid and several major tax cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\'s Julie Rovner reported that most of the health care reforms enacted in the past two decades have gone through reconciliation. President Ronald Reagan was one of the first presidents to make aggressive use of reconciliation when he pushed through his economic program in 1981. Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker said then that speed had been essential because "Every day that this is delayed makes it more difficult to pass. This is an extraordinary proposal, and these are extraordinary times."\n\n\n\n\n\nPresidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush all used reconciliation as well. It is worth noting that these presidents, particularly George W. Bush, also made use of sweeping executive power to circumvent Congress altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second question is more difficult and it involves perceptions. If the Democratic leadership wants to use this tactic, they have to convince enough members of their own party that this won\'t scare off independent voters. This argument was harder to make in 2009 than in 2010. But after a year of dealing with paralysis in the Senate and highly effective Republican obstruction, more Democrats are coming on board.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leadership must be proactive in responding to the criticism about reconciliation. They will have to explain that reconciliation is a legitimate process by pointing to the history.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey will also have to connect the dots for voters frustrated with the ineffective government by explaining that the constant use of the filibuster has turned the Senate into a supermajority institution where both parties have found it extraordinarily difficult -- virtually impossible -- to pass major legislation.On this point, Republicans and Democrats actually agree.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, as Democrats make this decision, Kentucky Republican Senator Jim Bunning is objecting to a unanimous consent order and single-handedly preventing the Senate from passing an important bill to assist unemployed workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats must also convince hesitant colleagues that the payoff could be greater than the cost. While, in the short-term, Republicans will complain that their opponents have rammed through social policy in some sort of unnatural procedural move, Democrats are facing these kinds of intense attacks anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\nRight now, Democrats are receiving the brunt of Republican attacks without being able to pass much legislation. If they pass health care, they will be able to respond to the arguments of the GOP, not just by complaining that Republicans obstruct everything, but by pointing to specific benefits such as lowering premiums by expanding how many people purchase coverage and bringing tens of millions of Americans into the health care system.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn certain respects, the White House made the use of reconciliation more difficult by initially accepting the notion that 60 votes were needed to pass legislation through the Senate. After the election of Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, a decision to refocus on procedures that only depend on 51 votes makes it more vulnerable to the attacks of manipulating the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in other respects, the administration now has a better political opportunity to use reconciliation. After a year, the public has seen just how dysfunctional Senate procedures can be in an era when filibusters are common.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a public that is frustrated by Washington, as the polls show, the Democrats might be able to persuade a sufficient number of their colleagues to go along. If they don\'t, one thing is for certain: Democrats will go into election day facing voters who are hearing all the complaints about their party but seeing very little in terms of what they can deliver on health care.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E.

He did not attend the week-long conference in Dharamsala, a town in the hills of north India where he lives in exile. He called the meeting, he said, to offer the exiles an opportunity to discuss "the best possible future course of action" for Tibet.\n\n\n\nTakhla said the Tibetans demonstrated that the Dalai Lama was their undisputed leader, and they hoped China would recognize him as such and negotiations toward a realistic solution could be held.\n\n\n\nThere was a small minority who said they wanted to demand Tibet\'s independence, Takhla said.\n\n\n\nThe "middle way" approach with Beijing is one in which Tibetans want a level of autonomy that will allow them to protect and preserve their culture, religion and national identity.

{'text': '(CNN) -- The power of the Mexican military was on full display Tuesday in Ciudad Juarez, where police reported the third consecutive day without a drug slaying.\n\n\n\nA federal police officer guards a checkpoint earlier this month in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico\n\n\n\nTen drug-related killings in a single day were common before 9,500 army troops poured into the blood-soaked border town in the past few weeks, said Mauricio Mauricio, a spokesman for the Juarez municipal police.\n\n\n\n"It\'s a much more secure city at this moment," he said. "We haven\'t had murders with the same regularity and frequency as before."\n\n\n\nBut as President Obama\'s administration announced plans Tuesday to beef up U.S. security along its border with Mexico, there are questions about whether increased military and police efforts in both nations can yield long-term results.\n\n\n\nMexico has been spiraling into a deepening pit of violence, with 6,500 people killed in 2008 and the body count continuing apace this year. Most of that violence is occurring along the border, which worries Washington.\n\n\n\nMexican President Felipe Calderon and others have said recently that the United States must share responsibility because the demand for drugs and most of the weapons used by drug cartels comes from north of the border.\n\n\n\nThe drug war and security will be a major topic when U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits Mexico on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\n\nAndrew Selee, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center\'s Mexico Institute, called Obama\'s pledge on Tuesday to give $700 million in aid to Mexico and assign an additional 360 staff along the border a "substantive commitment" that shows the United States is serious about attacking the problem.\n\n\n\n"It\'s an attempt to really put some substance behind the idea of shared responsibility," Selee said. "They finally committed some of the resources they said they would to this."\n\n\n\nSuccess will depend on the follow-through, he said.\n\n\n\n"Now is the hard part," he said. "It\'s not easy to follow the money trail or stop the weapons or the criminal networks."\n\n\n\nOthers say the Obama plan falls short.\n\n\n\nLarry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington policy institute, calls it a "militarized strategy" that isn\'t oriented toward finding solutions based on economic development or social justice programs.\n\n\n\n"This is a feel-good strategy that is meant to produce the illusion of concrete developments taking place when it\'s actually just really more of the same," Birns said. "You\'re talking about a 2,000-mile border, so the odd 16 [agents] here or 12 there is not going to do the trick."\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Mexico\'s major military commitment is certainly showing short-term benefits.\n\n\n\nBefore the army arrived in Ciudad Juarez, there had been more than 400 drug killings this year, police spokesman Mauricio said. Since the army arrived, slayings have dropped 95 percent, he said.\n\n\n\nPeter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue policy institute, says Mexico\'s use of the army in Juarez -- and its evident success -- "shows that Mexico is definitely not a failed state. Nobody is going to challenge the government for control of a certain area."\n\n\n\nSelee sees it as "increased determination from the Mexican government to establish order."\n\n\n\nBut there are limitations to using the military in Mexico, Birns and Hakim said.\n\n\n\n"There\'s bad blood that exists between local communities and the military," said Birns. "The Mexican military has not fought a war for years. It\'s enemy has always been the local population."\n\n\n\nHakim noted the cost in money, and to the daily fabric of life.\n\n\n\n"That\'s not a cheap way of keeping law and order," he said. "It does a great deal of harm to civilian institutions. The military is not trained to respect human liberties and individual rights."\n\n\n\nIt\'s an ambivalence that many Mexicans feel: security versus liberties.\n\n\n\nPolls consistently show that security is the top concern among a vast majority of Mexicans. And for many Mexican citizens, the drug war can still hit close to home no matter how far away they live from the front lines.\n\n\n\nAdrian Jesus Garrido Gomez, a 30-year-old bank loan officer with a wife and two young sons, lives in Tabasco state in southern Mexico, far from the violence tearing up Juarez and other border cities.\n\n\n\n"Tabasco has always been relatively safe," Garrido said by telephone Tuesday.\n\n\n\nHe said a childhood friend worked for 2½ years in a high-paying white-collar job in Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas. When he got married recently, his wife had one request: Let\'s move back to Tabasco. They did, six months ago.\n\n\n\n"For them, it (was) very insecure," Garrido said.\n\n\n\nReynosa was the site of a four-hour gun battle last month that left five drug traffickers dead and seven police wounded. People worldwide saw video of a television reporter sprawled on a bridge during that fight, trying to file an on-air report over the roar of gunfire.\n\n\n\nHakim says Mexican President Calderon\'s efforts to paint the United States as partially responsible for the violence is lost on some Mexicans.\n\n\n\n"In the end," Hakim said, "this is Mexico\'s problem as much as Mexico talks about a shared problem. The costs of not getting control of it will be paid by the Mexicans."', 'questions': [{'question': 'What is the top concern among most Mexicans?', 'answers': ['security', 'military', 'drug killings']}, {'question': 'What did the police report?', 'answers': ['drug slaying.', 'reported the third consecutive day without a drug slaying.', 'third consecutive day without', 'the third consecutive day without a drug slaying.', 'slaying.']}, {'question': 'What are the questions that remain?', 'answers': ['whether increased military and police efforts in both nations can yield long-term results.', 'whether increased military and police efforts in both nations can yield', 'results.']}, {'question': 'What has been consistently shown to be a top concern?', 'answers': ['security is the', 'a major topic when U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits Mexico', 'security', 'The drug war and security will']}, {'question': 'What entity do Mexicans distrust?', 'answers': ['security', '"There\'s bad blood that exists between local communities and the military," said Birns.', 'military,"']}, {'question': 'For how many days was there no drug slaying?', 'answers': ['third consecutive', 'the third consecutive']}, {'question': 'What is a top concern for Mexicans?', 'answers': ['security']}, {'question': 'What did the police report was third straight day of?', 'answers': ['drug slaying.', 'without', 'consecutive', 'without a drug slaying.', 'reported']}]}
{'text': 'New York (CNN) -- When Alec Baldwin closed out the Academy Awards on Sunday night by slapping director Kathryn Bigelow squarely on the backside, that pretty much said it all.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was Ladies\' Night in a Boys\' Town.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, the opening routine by Baldwin and Steve Martin was very funny; there was sincerity and genuine gratitude from many of the winners; despite weird digressions into arcane areas like sound recording, the program moved briskly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut did the orchestra need to follow Bigelow\'s win of her long-deserved best director prize, for "The Hurt Locker," by playing the old Helen Reddy song "I Am Woman"?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Zoe Saldana and Carey Mulligan arrived on stage to present the Best Original Song award, did they have to be intro-ed with "Thank Heaven For Little Girls"?\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in addition to being groped by Baldwin, did Bigelow have to be so muscled-in-on by her fellow producers when she was picking up the best picture award for her film, "The Hurt Locker"?\n\n\n\n\n\n\'The Hurt Locker\' wins six Oscars\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe that wacky Elinor Burkett had a point: The producer of "Music by Prudence" -- which had just won the Oscar for best documentary short -- barreled on stage, saying "Let the woman speak!" and commandeering the mike from her director, Roger Ross Williams.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe provided a classic moment of Oscar craziness and the one instance of spontaneity in an evening when all the big favorites won all the big prizes. Burkett seemed boorish, sure. But that doesn\'t necessarily make her wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences certainly faced a dilemma this year: Vote for the future, or make up for the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nYears from now, it will probably look profoundly shortsighted that "Avatar," one of the biggest movies ever -- and, more importantly, the one that indicates where movies are going -- didn\'t win the top prize when Hollywood had a chance to bestow it.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, the Oscars gave their most coveted awards to a small indie film about an unpopular war and a director whose sex had never before been honored with a best director prize.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat helped make it all so complicated was not that there\'s been a long, long history of overlooked genius female directors that the Oscars had to atone for.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sin at stake was -- and is -- that women simply have never been given an equal chance to direct.\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictably, Bigelow didn\'t have to be as good as the boys, she had to be better. And she was.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut earning your Oscars and actually getting them are two different things. Fortunately for Bigelow, she had history on her side last night.\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Cameron didn\'t.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe billions being made by "Avatar" will probably be some consolation, but neither he nor his movie are warm and fuzzy, which is what the Academy voters like.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the big-hearted, sentimental acceptance by best actor Jeff Bridges ("Crazy Heart"), and the rather elegant, funny remarks by best actress Sandra Bullock ("The Blind Side"), are exactly what we all want Oscar night to be.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat, and a few good jokes, which is what Martin and Baldwin provided, arriving on stage after a musical extravaganza starring Neil Patrick Harris that seemed ready to recall the bad old days of producer Alan Carr and the notorious Rob Lowe/Snow White musical overture of 1989.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking back on Oscar\'s \'train wreck\'\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing so ghastly reared its ugly head last night, although there were a few moments of bad choices, bad manners and a strategy that was, at best, elusive.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all the changing characters and categories on Oscar-watchers\' betting pool ballots, there are certain things we bet on no matter what: one, that the show will be interminable; two, that it will last at least until midnight (ET) no matter how they try to contain it; and, three, that there will be moments in the show itself that, although planned by seemingly sane individuals, will be inexplicable, if not grotesque.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast night did not disappoint. While someone like poor Tivi Magnusson got drowned out by the orchestra (after he and Joachim Back won best live action short for "The New Tenants"), the show\'s producers thought it made perfect sense to devote relatively huge chunks of time to examining the niceties of animated short subjects or providing weary viewers the inevitable, unspeakable interpretive dance number, this one devoted to the evening\'s musical scores.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore painful, at least to this viewer\'s eyes, was an overlong salute to the late director John Hughes, featuring a reunion of some of his more famous players, a few of whom -- Molly Ringwald, for instance, and Judd Nelson -- looked positively shell shocked.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only surprises of the night were in the best foreign film category: The Argentine "El Secreto de Sus Ojos," beat out the favored "White Ribbon," thus continuing the Oscar tradition of giving the foreign-film prize to something few have even seen (a foreign-film Oscar doesn\'t do much good, one should remember, for a movie that\'s already opened and closed).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other surprise was the rudeness with which costume designer Sandy Powell accepted her "Young Victoria" Oscar.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I\'ve already got two of these," she said, before dissing her coworkers and, by extension, the Academy in toto.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrusque dismissal is not a quality Oscar tolerates very well and it\'s not likely Ms. Powell will be back, unlike Martin and Baldwin, who were the funniest Oscar hosts ever, proving there\'s power in numbers, the sum often can be more than the parts, and that it\'s always good to have an extra pair of hands, as long as they stay off Kathryn Bigelow\'s butt.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Anderson.', 'questions': [{'question': 'what was avatar nominated for', 'answers': ['Oscar', 'Academy']}, {'question': 'The critic said a salaute to which late director was long overdue', 'answers': ['John Hughes,']}, {'question': 'what did the critic say', 'answers': ["It was Ladies' Night in a Boys' Town."]}, {'question': 'Who is John Hughes?', 'answers': ['late director', 'director']}, {'question': 'Who were the funniest Oscar hosts, according to a critic?', 'answers': ['Martin and Baldwin,', 'Martin', 'Baldwin,']}, {'question': 'What has Oscar had to atone for?', 'answers': ['long history of overlooked genius female directors', 'long history of overlooked genius female directors that the', 'overlooked genius female directors']}, {'question': 'Which two people were said to be the funniest hosts ever', 'answers': ['Martin', 'Baldwin,']}, {'question': "John Anderson said the Oscar's had to atone for what", 'answers': ['overlooked genius female directors', 'long history of overlooked genius female directors']}]}

{'text': 'PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN) -- It was supposed to be just another day at work.\n\nJob losses suffered by Linda and Chris Metzger have had a ripple effect on other businesses in their community\n\nIn early March 2008, 31-year-old Linda Metzger went to the New York office where she had worked as an assistant vice president in the marketing department at Lehman Brothers for about a year. Only 15 minutes into her work day, Metzger was called into her manager\'s office, where a representative from human resources was waiting.\n\n"They told me that the company was having economic difficulties and that they had to make budget cuts," Metzger said. "They were afraid that they were going to have to let me go and that it was not due to performance."\n\nMetzger says that would be her last day at Lehman Brothers. She was given some time to collect her composure, gather her belongings and head home.\n\nShe was out of a $90,000-a-year job and was getting married in three months. Metzger says it was a chance for her and her fiancÃ© to refocus, relocate and start a new life.\n\nWithin a few weeks, they both found jobs near Phoenix, Arizona, earning close to what they were making in New York. They bought a home and two new cars and got married.\n\nBut the good feelings suddenly and dramatically ended in October when Metzger, who was four months pregnant, showed up to work at Lumension, where she was a marketing manager.\n\nMetzger says she was called into the office, and it happened again. She was laid off from her second job in less than a year.  Watch Linda talk about getting laid off Â»\n\n"I was so overwhelmed and so shocked that I just immediately burst into tears."\n\nShe thought about how she and her new husband, who had just moved across the country, were going to be able to afford their new life and all the bills that came with it.\n\nA week later, Chris Metzger was called into his manager\'s office at the job placement agency where he worked. He was told that because of the economy, his office was closing, and he was out of a job. Now he had to break the news to his wife.\n\n"I just came home, and she was upstairs," Chris Metzger said. He tried to find the best way to tell his wife that they no longer had an income. "I walked upstairs, I gave her a hug, and I said, \'I lost my job today.\' "\n\n"I immediately fell to the floor and just started crying," Linda said.\n\nWithin 10 days, Chris was able to find a new job, but Linda had no such luck. The economy was taking its toll, and very few companies were hiring. They looked at their budget and started to eliminate all the extras, including dining out and gym memberships. Vacations were put on hold; furniture purchases had to wait; fine meals out were now home-cooked meals.\n\nThe Metzgers\' story is playing out all across America as businesses and communities feel the ripple effect of the recession\n\n"When jobs get lost, demand falls for a whole bunch of businesses. You\'re not going to buy new shoes; you\'re going to put new soles on them," said Lakshman Achuthan, managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, an independent group that studies recessions.\n\nRestaurants where the Metzgers used to dine are now closed. The furniture store where they hoped to fill their home is having a liquidation sale and is closing in three weeks.\n\n"You\'ve pulled back from all your spending except paying your mortgage and putting food on the table," Achuthan said.\n\nIt\'s a sign of the times. A drive down the Phoenix streets and strip malls are filled with vacant office space .\n\nChris and Linda Metzger are expecting their first child in April.

{'text': 'Editor\'s note: Leslie Morgan Steiner is the author of "Crazy Love," a new memoir about domestic violence, and the anthology "Mommy Wars," which explores the polarization between stay-at-home and career moms.\n\nLeslie Morgan Steiner says domestic violence afflicts the well-to-do as well as the poor.\n\n(CNN) -- For two days, news reports called her "the 20-year old victim" allegedly attacked by R&B singer and dancer Chris Brown in his car early February 8 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nWe all now have good reason to believe that the alleged victim was pop singer Rihanna, Brown\'s girlfriend.\n\nThe story has dominated the general media with good reason. Both singers are young, apple-cheek gorgeous, immensely talented and squeaky clean -- the last couple you\'d imagine as domestic violence headliners.\n\nPerhaps the only good that will come from the Rihanna/Brown publicity is destruction of our culture\'s misconception that abusers and their victims can only be universally poor, uneducated and powerless.\n\nBrown, whose first song debuted at No. 1 and whose first album topped the Billboard Hot 100, appeared on a Disney sitcom and in Sesame Street, Got Milk? and Wrigley\'s Doublemint Gum commercials. Barbados-born Rihanna has been big-brothered by music industry legends like Jay-Z and Kanye West and is signed to the Def Jam Recordings label.\n\nShe has been astonishingly successful in the short time she has been on the music scene, attaining five Billboard Hot 100 No. 1\'s with "SOS," "Umbrella," "Take a Bow," "Disturbia" and T.I.\'s "Live Your Life."\n\nLike Rihanna, I had a bright future in my early 20s. I met my abusive lover at 22. I\'d just graduated from Harvard and had a job at Seventeen Magazine in New York.\n\nMy husband worked on Wall Street and was an Ivy League graduate as well. In our world, we were the last couple you\'d imagine enmeshed in domestic violence.\n\nMany of my ex-husband\'s attacks also took place in our car. For reasons I never understood, the enclosed, soundproof space brought out his worst violence. He punched me so fiercely that my face had bruises from his fist on one side and from hitting the window on the other.\n\nAs trapped in the car as I was in our marriage, it was there that I endured tirades about how controlling I was with money, how flirtatious and naïve I was with other men, how defiant and disrespectful I was of my husband\'s authority.\n\nSo, I suppose I have more understanding than most about the shame, fury, confusion and disappointment Rihanna may be experiencing. What\'s hardest for outsiders to fathom is how lethal a cocktail love, hope and sympathy can be. I first fell for my husband the night he confided how he, like Chris Brown, had been traumatized as a young boy by domestic violence in his home.\n\n"He used to hit my mom ... He made me terrified all the time, terrified like I had to pee on myself," Brown said during a 2007 interview with Giant magazine.\n\nBrown hasn\'t explained what happened in the recent incident, but this week he released a statement saying that he\'s sorry and saddened by it.\n\nOur culture encourages women to nurture men, making it predictable that many experience a seductive empathy for abusive men, as well as the misguided hope that love can obliterate an ugly past.\n\nIn my case, it took four years, myriad terrifying attacks, and the intervention of the police and family court before I understood how little I could help my ex get over his abusive childhood.\n\nI certainly felt alone during my abusive relationship, but unfortunately I was in good company. The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that between 1 million and 3 million women in America are physically abused by their husband or boyfriend each year.\n\nEvery day, on average, three women are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends. At some point in our lives, 25 percent of American women will report being physically abused or raped by intimate partners, according to the National Violence Against Women Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHowever, these statistics, grim as they are, fail to highlight the root of the abuse cycle. A national survey showed that 50 percent of men who frequently assault their wives also frequently abuse their children.\n\nWitnessing abuse, as Chris Brown and my ex-husband did as young boys, is a form of abuse itself. Tragically, many victims of childhood abuse grow up to be abusers themselves. I always sensed that my husband didn\'t want to be hurting me -- he knew exactly how excruciating love and fear felt mixed together -- but his childhood rage overpowered his adult sensibilities.\n\nA few months after I left my marriage, I happened across another couple in another car, late at night on an empty street. I slowed down as a well-dressed woman about 25 years old was walking away from a white Honda, brushing off a tall, handsome young man wearing a sports coat and jeans.\n\nSuddenly she turned and tried to run. He grabbed her with his long arms and shoved her up against a dirty storefront. Even from my car I could see the fear on her pretty face.\n\nWithout thinking, I jerked my car over and got out. By this time the man had let the woman go and she\'d slid behind the wheel of the car. He stepped back as I approached, his anger displaced by uncertainty and shame at being interrupted. I didn\'t look at him. I leaned into the car as she sat clutching the wheel, crying and staring straight ahead.\n\n"I just left a husband who beat me for three years," I said. "You do not have to put up with this. You do not deserve to be treated like this."\n\n"I know," she whispered as fresh tears poured down her face. She sniffed loudly and shook her head. She wouldn\'t look at me. Her eyes were rimmed red, but I could see resolve in them.\n\n"You\'re right," she said. "It\'s just taking me longer than I thought."\n\nAs I left, I gave the man a long stare.

{'text': '(EW.com) -- Although it didn\'t set a franchise record, "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 1" had one of the best openings in box-office history by debuting to $139.5 million, according to studio estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\'s the fifth-best opening weekend ever, behind "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2," "The Dark Knight," "Spider-Man 3," and "The Twilight Saga: New Moon," which held on to the franchise record.\n\n\n\n\n\n"New Moon" debuted to a slightly better $142.8 million on the same November weekend two years ago. What\'s interesting is how closely "Breaking Dawn" followed "New Moon\'s" trajectory. "New Moon" grossed $72.7 million its first day, and then dropped 42 percent on Saturday and 34 percent on Sunday. By comparison, "Breaking Dawn" earned $72 million on Friday (the third-best opening day ever), and then fell 44 percent on Saturday and a projected 34 percent today.\n\n\n\n\n\n"New Moon" ultimately finished its domestic run with $296.6 million, and it\'s too early to tell whether "Breaking Dawn" will wind up a bit short of that final figure. Even if it does, Summit Entertainment won\'t be complaining about grossing nearly $300 million from the fourth movie of its franchise. And, of course, the domestic box office is only a part of the equation here. "Breaking Dawn" took in $144 million from 54 foreign territories this week, pushing its worldwide debut to a staggering $283.5 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummit reports that "Breaking Dawn" attracted a crowd that was, unsurprisingly, 80 percent female. What is surprising is that the PG-13 movie\'s audience wasn\'t as young as you\'d think, with 60 percent over the age of 21. According to CinemaScore, 30 percent of the film\'s audience was under 18, but an even larger 42 percent was between the ages of 18 and 34. The popular conception is that The "Twilight Saga" is merely a teenage phenomenon, but these figures seem to prove otherwise. The $110 million movie received a good-but-not-great B+ rating from CinemaScore graders.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn second place was Warner Bros.\' 3-D animated sequel "Happy Feet Two," which fell far short of expectations by dancing to only $22 million. The 2006 original, an Oscar winner for best animated feature, opened to $41.5 million -- and that was without the benefit of 3-D surcharges.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Happy Feet Two" was saddled with mediocre reviews, which might have discouraged some parents. Furthermore, five years could have been too long of a wait, especially for a sequel that appeared very similar to its predecessor. The original "Happy Feet" was released a year after March of the Penguins, when the Antarctic birds were having a moment in the cultural zeitgeist. That moment has clearly passed. The $135 million sequel earned a B+ rating from CinemaScore moviegoers, and 3-D theaters accounted for 50 percent of its weekend tally.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of the top five consisted of holdovers. The 3-D action flick "Immortals" dropped a harsh 62 percent for $12.3 million -- a second-weekend decline that was larger than both "300" (54 percent) and "Clash of the Titans" (57 percent). "Jack and Jill" witnessed a typical Adam Sandler fall of 52 percent for $12 million. And even though "Happy Feet Two" underperformed, "Puss in Boots" lost much of its family audience. The animated adventure dropped 57 percent for $10.7 million in its fourth weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn limited release, Alexander Payne\'s "The Descendants," starring George Clooney, debuted to $1.2 million from 29 theaters -- enough for a tenth-place finish. The Oscar hopeful raked in an impressive $42,150 per location. Only "Midnight in Paris," "The Tree of Life," and "Jane Eyre" opened to stronger per-theater averages this year, and those movies started out on far fewer screens than "The Descendants."\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

{'text': 'TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- A former Iranian presidential candidate is calling on one of the Islamic republic\'s most powerful clerics to approve a special committee to investigate alleged mistreatment of detainees arrested in the aftermath of the disputed presidential elections.\n\n\n\nMehdi Karrubi says an "impartial committee" is needed to investigate alleged mistreatment of detainees.\n\n\n\nIn an open letter to Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani posted Saturday on his party\'s Web site, reformist Mehdi Karrubi says an "impartial committee" is needed to "investigate these tragedies with transparency until they are resolved." He said he is willing to lead the investigation in a "truthful, unbiased fashion."\n\n\n\nThe letter is dated July 29 and was posted on the Karrubi\'s Eetemade-Melli (National Trust) party\'s Web site, called Saham News. The Web site said the letter was posted after Rafsanjani failed to respond.\n\n\n\nThe treatment of detainees at Iran\'s prisons has increasingly become a high profile issue, with human-rights groups accusing guards of conducting harsh interrogations, beatings, sleep deprivation, and threats of torture to coerce false confessions.\n\n\n\nIranian media reported that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\'s supreme leader, ordered one prison, Kahrizak, shut down amid reports it did not measure up to the required standards. Kahrizak\'s chief was fired and arrested over allegations of detainee mistreatment, according to local reports Saturday.\n\n\n\nA special parliamentary committee has made rounds at Tehran\'s Evin prison, but did not find any signs of abuse, according to recent media reports. Hundreds of detainees have since been reportedly released from Evin, though "political figures" were held and put on trial.\n\n\n\nIn his plea for an investigation, Karrubi says he has heard descriptions of torture and violence that make his "body shake," though he doesn\'t specify a prison.\n\n\n\n"Some of the former detainees have told of such brutal and violent, repeated rapes of the young women [in detention] that have caused irreparable damage to their reproductive systems," Karrubi says in the letter. "Others have raped our detained young men with such brutality that they [the victims] have been afflicted by depression and are no longer speaking with anyone and refuse to leave the dark corners of their houses."\n\n\n\nHe adds that an investigation will "teach a lesson to the thugs and criminals in the future and prevent the smearing of the reputation of the Islamic Republic."\n\n\n\nRafsanjani -- a former president and head of the Assembly of Experts, the council responsible for appointing or removing the supreme leader -- called for the release of the detainees during a highly anticipated July 17 sermon at Friday prayers.\n\n\n\nHe backed Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi in the presidential election, in which hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming winner. Karrubi and Moussavi unsuccessfully challenged the results for weeks, and Ahmadinejad was sworn in for his second term last week.\n\n\n\nRafsanjani himself has been accused of helping fuel the post-election unrest as part of recent mass trials of the remaining detainees over the past week.', 'questions': [{'question': 'What does Karrubi claim happened to both men and women?', 'answers': ['brutal', 'mistreatment', 'rapes', 'violent, repeated rapes']}, {'question': 'In what elction was Mehdi Karrubi a candidate?', 'answers': ['Iranian', 'presidential election,', 'former Iranian presidential']}, {'question': 'Who called for investigation into the letter?', 'answers': ['Mehdi Karrubi']}, {'question': 'What is he willing to do?', 'answers': ['lead the investigation in a "truthful, unbiased fashion."']}, {'question': 'What was called for by him?', 'answers': ['most powerful clerics to approve a special committee to investigate alleged mistreatment of detainees arrested in the aftermath', 'former', 'the release of the detainees during a highly anticipated July 17 sermon at Friday prayers.', 'presidential elections.', 'of the disputed', 'A', "Iranian presidential candidate is calling on one of the Islamic republic's"]}, {'question': 'What is Karrubi looking to investigate?', 'answers': ['alleged mistreatment of detainees.', 'mistreatment of detainees.', 'alleged mistreatment of detainees arrested in the aftermath of the disputed presidential elections.']}, {'question': "What are some of the claims he's making?", 'answers': ['detainee mistreatment,', 'alleged mistreatment of detainees arrested in the aftermath of the disputed presidential elections.']}, {'question': 'What was he a candidate for?', 'answers': ['Iranian presidential', 'approve a special committee to investigate alleged mistreatment of detainees']}]}

{'text': '(CNN) -- Civilians are in hiding in the Yemeni capital as protesters and government forces struggle for control on the streets of Sanaa.\n\n\n\n\n\nResidents in Sanaa are stranded in their homes, and some even fear looking out of their windows as they are left to wonder how long the violence will rage around them.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We can\'t leave our houses to get food for our children.

Multiple witnesses and medics said dozens were killed in a violent government crackdown that started on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nProtesters have used Change Square for a seven-month sit-in demanding the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. He is recuperating in Saudi Arabia from a attack in June on his palace but has vowed to return to Yemen to finish his term.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach wounded protester was carried by six or seven others -- sometimes friends of the casualty -- and taken to the medical camp in the square. Drops of blood created trails on the ground tracing the long, bloody route to a field hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the medical camp, hundreds of young people were covered in blood and screaming from pain.

{'text': '(CNN) -- U.S. Air Force officials called off their response late Friday afternoon at a Tucson, Arizona, base after reports that an armed man had entered an office building, the U.S. military branch said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier in the day, a U.S. military official told CNN that a gunman was believed to be holed up in a building at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis precipitated the Air Force to call for a lock-down -- which began at 10:30 a.m. -- "following the unconfirmed sighting of" such a man.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo shots were ever fired and law enforcement teams are on site, said the official, who had direct knowledge of the situation from conversations with base officials but did not want to be identified.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, at 6 p.m., Col. John Cherrey -- who commands the Air Force\'s 355th Fighter Wing -- told reporters that no gunman or weapon was ever found. He added that the building, where the gunman was once thought to have entered, has been secured after authorities went through it room-by-room.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement came about two hours after the Air Force stated that its officials had "terminated" their response to the incident. All base personnel were leaving via a "controlled release."\n\n\n\n\n\n"With the help of the Tucson emergency services communities, Airmen were successful in maintaining the safety and security of the Desert Lightning Team," the Air Force said, alluding to the name used for Air Force personnel based in the arid southern Arizona locale.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, Tucson Police Sgt.

{'text': 'LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Natasha Richardson, the Tony Award-winning stage actress and member of the famed Redgrave acting clan, died Wednesday from injuries suffered in a ski accident. She was 45.\n\nComedian Joan Rivers says actress Natasha Richardson had "such a family."\n\nOn Wednesday night\'s "Larry King Live," comedian Joan Rivers remembered Richardson for her marriage to actor Liam Neeson and used her sharp wit to recall her own skiing experience.\n\nThe following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\nLarry King: You knew Natasha Richardson. What was your reaction?\n\nJoan Rivers: Oh, [it] shouldn\'t have happened. We were more acquaintances than friends. But we spent one amazing day on a boat with my whole family and she and Liam and the boys. And they were such a family.\n\nKing: What was the occasion?\n\nRivers: We were all in the Caribbean, and we all kind of knew each other from dinner parties and so forth. And we met at the airport, and we said, "Oh, let\'s get together, with the kids." And it was one of those wonderful days. We laughed and talked and had lunch, and the kids were jumping off the boat and we were drinking wine. She was just amazing and darling.\n\nKing: Have you seen her work on Broadway?\n\nRivers: I\'ve seen her work. I love actresses who go back and forth. I always have such great respect for someone who goes to Broadway and then film and goes back again. I saw her in "The Philadelphia Story" years ago in London when she won an award. She was very young in a musical version of that.\n\nKing: What was your read on them as a couple that day?\n\nRivers: Totally happy, totally devoted to each other. That\'s what kills me. I mean [it] just shouldn\'t have happened. ... And they made such a good-looking couple, too. He doted on what she said, she doted on -- it was just perfect.\n\nKing: How did you learn of this yesterday?\n\nRivers: One of our mutual friends called me and said, do you know about -- I just saw them recently in the thing that Prince Charles gave in England, and a mutual friend said, did you heard about what happened to Natasha? I said, what are you talking about? And he said, she\'s brain-dead.  Watch King talk to celebrities about Richardson »\n\nKing: So you knew yesterday?\n\nRivers: I knew yesterday. And I knew yesterday that she was brain-dead. And I was told, which is, again, so dear, that they kept her alive purposely to bring her back to New York, so that the boys could say goodbye to her before --\n\nKing: Really?\n\nRivers: Yes.\n\nKing: That\'s both beautiful and sad.\n\nRivers: Look at this, it gets me crazy. It\'s sad.\n\nKing: Do you ski?\n\nRivers: I had a terrible fall about 12 years ago. And I lay there in the snow and I said to myself, "If I get up, I\'m not coming back and I got up."\n\nKing: You\'re like, "Goodbye."\n\nRivers: Goodbye. And I swear to you, I laid on the ground and I go, "If everything works, that\'s it. That\'s it."\n\nKing: You\'ve heard the doctor. What do you make of this? There must have been something previously. It was a slight fall?\n\nRivers: You don\'t know; you hit your head wrong. You walk out of your house and it\'s over.

{'text': '(CNN) -- German car manufacturer BMW has announced it is to pull out of Formula One at the end of the current season after a "landmark" decision to restructure the group\'s motorsport activities was made by the company\'s board in a meeting on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nBMW Sauber have opted to pull out Formula One at the end of the 2009 season.\n\n\n\nA statement on the BMW Sauber F1 Team\'s official Web site stated that "the Formula One campaign is [no longer] a key promoter for us" and that "current developments in motor sport" had resulted in the decision.\n\n\n\nDr Norbert Reithofer, chairman of the BMW board of management, said: "Of course, this was a very difficult decision for us. But it\'s a resolute step in view of our company\'s strategic realignment."\n\n\n\nThe team currently lie eighth in the constructors\' world championship with eight points after 10 rounds and of their two drivers -- Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld -- Heidfeld sits a lowly 13th in the drivers\' championship with just six points.\n\n\n\nBMW are the second manufacturer to pull out of F1 in a further blow to the sport after Honda\'s withdrawal before the start of the 2009 season.  CNN\'s analysis of BMW\'s exit from Formula One. »\n\n\n\nHowever, since Wednesday\'s announcement, rival German car manufacturer Mercedes have reconfirmed their commitment to the sport.\n\n\n\n"We regret the withdrawal of BMW from Formula One. This decision will not have the slightest influence on our commitment to Formula One," a spokesman for the company told AFP.\n\n\n\nMotorsport\'s world governing body, the FIA, reiterated their belief that the move was an indication of how the global economic downturn was affecting the sport.\n\n\n\nIn a statement on their official Web site, they said: "The FIA regrets the announcement of BMW\'s intended withdrawal from Formula One but is not surprised by it. It has been clear for some time that motor sport cannot ignore the world economic crisis.\n\n\n\n"Car manufacturers cannot be expected to continue to pour large sums of money into Formula One when their survival depends on redundancies, plant closures and the support of the taxpayer. This is why the FIA prepared regulations to reduce costs drastically.\n\n\n\n"These measures were needed to alleviate the pressure on manufacturers following Honda\'s withdrawal but also to make it possible for new teams to enter. Had these regulations not been so strongly opposed by a number of team principals, the withdrawal of BMW and further such announcements in the future might have been avoided," the statement added.\n\n\n\nBMW entered Formula One with a takeover of the Sauber F1 team in 2005 and finished fifth in the constructors\' championship in their debut campaign, before racing under their own name in 2006.\n\n\n\nWith an aggressive aim of winning the world championship within three years, the team came close in 2007 finishing second to Ferrari, thanks largely to the exclusion of McLaren-Mercedes from the manufacturer\'s points standings. In 2008, the team captured third, thanks in part to a first win in the Canadian Grand Prix for Polish driver Kubica.\n\n\n\nThe statement continued: "It only took us three years to establish ourselves as a top team with the BMW Sauber F1 team. Unfortunately, the team were unable to meet expectations in the current season."\n\n\n\nThe car-builder was also unable to "quantify redundancies" that may come from the move which follows the exit of  Honda in December.\n\n\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer -- who according to FIA president Max Mosley were spending $500m a season to compete in the sport -- cited the "sudden contraction of the world economies" as their reason to end racing.\n\n\n\nThis led to Mosley spearheading an FIA plan to enforce controversial cost-cutting measures on the teams for the 2010 season. The Formula One furor explained.\n\n\n\nThese measures, which split opinion within the sport, are expected to be adopted in a watered-down form and could eventually save $60 million from the cost of running a team, according to Mosley.\n\n\n\nHowever, the FIA were prompted by BMW\'s exit to warn again that if the measures were weakened too much the positive impact on the sport could be reduced.\n\n\n\n"As a result of a sustained cost-cutting campaign by the FIA, new measures are in the process of being agreed which should make it easier for new teams to enter and enable existing ones to participate on much reduced budgets.\n\n\n\n"It is no secret that these measures do not go as far as the FIA would have liked but a compromise was needed in the interests of harmony in the sport. Hopefully it will be enough to prevent further withdrawals and provide a solid foundation for Formula One," the statement read.', 'questions': [{'question': 'In what year did BMW enter the sport?', 'answers': ['2005', '2006.']}, {'question': 'What reason does BMW give for leaving?', 'answers': ['"the Formula One campaign is [no longer] a key promoter', 'us"']}, {'question': 'what did BMW announce?', 'answers': ['it is to pull out of Formula One at the end of the', 'pull out of Formula One at the end of the', 'current', 'current season']}, {'question': 'When did BMW enter Formula One?', 'answers': ['2005', '2006.', 'in 2005', 'entered']}, {'question': 'What does BMW announce?', 'answers': ['Sauber have opted to pull out Formula One', 'has announced it is to pull out of Formula One', 'it is to pull out of Formula One at the end of the', 'pull out of Formula One', 'current season']}, {'question': 'What is the current position of the F1 team?', 'answers': ['key promoter for us"', 'Formula One campaign is [no longer]', 'company\'s strategic realignment."', '"current developments in motor sport"']}, {'question': 'When is BMW leaving Formula One', 'answers': ['the end of the', 'at the end of the', 'at the end of the 2009 season.', 'current season']}, {'question': 'what is the current porpuse of German motor manufacturer?', 'answers': ['decision', "restructure the group's motorsport activities", 'season', 'pull out of Formula One at the end of the']}]}

{'text': 'LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson\'s family and about 200 of their closest friends gathered on a hill Thursday evening for their final farewell to the pop singer, who died 10 weeks ago.\n\n\n\nThursday\'s service for singer Michael Jackson began 90 minutes past the announced start time.\n\n\n\nJackson\'s burial may lay to rest some of the mystery and controversy that erupted with his sudden death on June 25.\n\n\n\nHis large family was divided over where the superstar\'s final resting place should be, but matriarch Katherine Jackson settled on a crypt inside the well-guarded and ornate Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, California.\n\n\n\nThursday\'s service began 90 minutes past the announced start time, leaving dozens of celebrities -- including Elizabeth Taylor -- waiting in their seats for the 26 cars carrying the Jackson clan to arrive.  Gallery: Invitation for Jackson\'s service »\n\n\n\nIt began with Jackson\'s five brothers -- each wearing a single sequined glove -- carrying his flower-covered bronze casket onto the outdoor stage among six large bouquets of white lilies and white roses, along with green topiaries.\n\n\n\nHis three children, led by daughter, Paris, 11, placed a crown atop their father\'s coffin, which a family spokesman said it was "to signify the final resting place of the King of Pop."\n\n\n\nJackson\'s children, parents and siblings took their seats in the front row, while his nieces and nephews filled several rows of white chairs behind them.\n\n\n\nAfter an opening prayer by Pastor Lucius Smith, soul music legend Gladys Knight sang the gospel hymn "His Eye Is on the Sparrow."\n\n\n\nClifton Davis sang "Never Can Say Goodbye," a hit he wrote for The Jackson 5 -- the group that featured a young Michael and his brothers.\n\n\n\nWhat was said by Jackson\'s father, Joe Jackson, and others who took the lectern is not publicly known, because the family barred news cameras from the ceremony. A family statement issued afterward said close friends and family, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, spoke "spontaneously to celebrate Michael\'s life."\n\n\n\nNews helicopters hovering above captured video from a distance, but without sound.  Watch media cover Jackson funeral »\n\n\n\nLisa Marie Presley, one of Jackson\'s former wives and the daughter of Elvis, attended the service, according to the family statement. It did not mention Debbie Rowe, Jackson\'s second wife and the mother of his two oldest children.\n\n\n\nMacaulay Culkin, the "Home Alone" actor who spent time with Jackson during his Neverland Ranch days, was there with his girlfriend, actress Mila Kunis.\n\n\n\nActors Corey Feldman and Chris Tucker were also seen arriving for the service.\n\n\n\nMotown founder Berry Gordy, who gave Jackson and his brothers their first big record deal, and Quincy Jones, who produced Jackson\'s "Thriller" album, were there. Music producer Teddy Riley, who helped with Jackson\'s 1991 "Dangerous" album, attended.\n\n\n\nThe guest list included TV executive Suzanne de Passe, who produced a miniseries about Jackson\'s family, and Kenny Ortega,  who was producing Jackson\'s comeback show.\n\n\n\nThomas Mesereau, the lawyer who successfully defended Jackson in a child molestation trial, sat just behind the Jackson family.\n\n\n\nWhen the hour-long service ended, his brothers lifted Jackson\'s casket for a final time to carry him inside the Great Mausoleum, where he was placed in his crypt at 9:43 p.m. PT (12:43 a.m. ET Friday).\n\n\n\nThe family statement said it was "his final resting place."\n\n\n\nThe family and friends then drove to an Italian restaurant eight miles away, in Pasadena, California, for "a time of celebration."\n\n\n\nThe massive mausoleum, the final resting place for Clark Gable, Carole Lombard and dozens of other celebrities, is normally open to tourists, though the public is denied close access to crypts. Security guards, aided by cameras, keep constant vigil over the graves and crypts, which are surrounded by a world-class collection of art and architecture.\n\n\n\nThe Forest Lawn Web site boasts that the mausoleum, which draws its architectural inspiration from the Campo Santo in Italy, "has been called the \'New World\'s Westminster Abbey\' by Time Magazine."\n\n\n\nVisitors will see "exact replicas of Michelangelo\'s greatest works such as David, Moses, and La Pieta" and "Leonardo da Vinci\'s immortal Last Supper re-created in brilliant stained glass; two of the world\'s largest paintings," the Web site says.\n\n\n\nJackson\'s burial was delayed by division among family members, though Katherine Jackson would make the final decision, brother Jermaine Jackson recently told CNN.\n\n\n\nHe preferred to see his youngest brother laid to rest at his former Neverland Ranch home, north of Los Angeles in Santa Barbara County, California.\n\n\n\nThat idea was complicated by neighbors who vowed to oppose allowing a grave in the rural area -- and by Jackson family members who said the singer would not want to return to the home where he faced child molestation charges, of which he was ultimately acquitted.\n\n\n\nThe mystery of where Jackson would be buried became a media obsession in the weeks after his death.\n\n\n\nAfter his body was loaded onto a helicopter at UCLA\'s Ronald Reagan Medical Center hours after his June 25 death, it stayed in the custody of the Los Angeles County coroner for an autopsy.\n\n\n\nIt was only later disclosed that Jackson\'s corpse was kept in a refrigerated room at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn cemetery until his casket was carried by motorcade to downtown Los Angeles for a public memorial service in the Staples Center arena.\n\n\n\nAgain, speculation about Jackson\'s whereabouts grew when the media lost track of his casket after his brothers carried it out of sight inside the arena. It was only recently confirmed that it was taken back to the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn while awaiting his family\'s decision.\n\n\n\nThough Thursday\'s interment may settle one Jackson mystery, a more serious one remains. The coroner announced last week that he had ruled Jackson\'s death a homicide. A summary of the coroner\'s report said the anesthetic propofol and the sedative lorazepam were the primary drugs responsible for the singer\'s death.\n\n\n\nLos Angeles police detectives have not concluded their criminal investigation and no one has been charged.', 'questions': [{'question': 'What famous guests were there?', 'answers': ['Kenny Ortega,', 'Quincy Jones,', 'Teddy Riley,', 'Clifton Davis', 'Actors Corey Feldman and Chris Tucker', 'Lisa Marie Presley,', 'Thomas Mesereau,', 'Berry Gordy,', 'Macaulay Culkin,', 'list included', 'Pastor Lucius Smith,', 'Mila Kunis.', 'Suzanne de Passe,', "Michael Jackson's family", 'Gladys Knight']}, {'question': 'Who sang Never Can Say Goodbye?', 'answers': ['Clifton Davis']}, {'question': 'what other important guest were included at the funeral?', 'answers': ['Suzanne de Passe,', 'Kenny Ortega,', 'TV executive Suzanne de Passe,']}, {'question': 'Who were amongst the guests?', 'answers': ['Teddy Riley,', 'Clifton Davis', 'Berry Gordy,', 'Mila Kunis.', 'siblings', 'including Elizabeth Taylor', 'Kenny Ortega,', 'Gladys Knight', 'Quincy Jones,', 'Chris Tucker', "Jackson's children, parents", 'Pastor Lucius Smith,', 'TV executive Suzanne de Passe,', 'Suzanne de Passe,', 'Elizabeth Taylor', 'Macaulay Culkin,', 'Corey Feldman', 'Rev.

E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (Steven Spielberg, 1982) Spielberg\'s magic captures a perfect moment in childhood. We laughed and wept as his ugly little critter from outer space stole our hearts, while the kids fell firmly on the cute side of annoying. And oh, the music...\n\n\n\n2. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (Mel Stuart, 1971) Gene Wilder\'s whacked-out Willy Wonka adds a pinch of sinister to Roald Dahl\'s anarchic sweet treat, while the ignoble exits of Veruca Salt, Augustus Gloop and Mike Teevee were delicious.\n\n\n\n3. Babe (Chris Noonan, 1995) "That\'ll do, pig." Babe is wide-eyed with wonder in Dick King-Smith\'s touching tale of a lonely little sheep-pig. Comic relief from the ewes, subtle special effects and a heartwarming turn from James Cromwell as Farmer Hoggett make this a magical tale for all.\n\n\n\n4. Bugsy Malone (Alan Parker, 1976) Jodie Foster and Scott Baio (Yes, Chachi from "Happy Days!") star in this glorious escapade set in a musical world of pint-sized gangsters and mini-molls. Al Capone for the kids; just watch out for the splurge guns...\n\n\n\n5. Oliver! (Carol Reed, 1968) Jack Wild is delightful as the Artful Dodger, Ron Moody\'s devilish Fagin glints with avaricious greed and Shani Willis shines as poor, ill-fated Nancy. But it\'s Oliver Reed\'s dark and sinister Bill Sykes who stayed with us -- and left us wanting more.\n\n\n\n6.

All that, and a skateboarding Michael J. Fox? Mr Zemeckis, you spoil us!\n\n\n\n7. Home Alone (Chris Columbus, 1990) Macaulay Culkin\'s abandoned little boy sees off bungling burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern with a series of eye-watering stunts. It proves just how great a child actor Culkin was; pity the unpopular babysitters who became the victims of copycat pranksters...\n\n\n\n8. Ghostbusters (Ivan Reitman, 1984) Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis blast ghostly green monsters to oblivion in this slime-filled romp around NYC, while taking time out to annoy Sigourney Weaver en route. Who you gonna call?\n\n\n\n9. The Muppet Movie (James Frawley, 1979) Kermit and Co.\'s roadtrip to Hollywood is a fabulously fuzzy tale of friendship and following your dreams, but the Muppet Movie\'s not just for kids: there\'s cameos a-plenty (Bob Hope, Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, ORSON WELLES!) for Dad and smart one-liners by the bucketful for Mom.\n\n\n\n10. Harry Potter (Various, 2001-present) The Hogwarts trio\'s wizarding adventures, backed by a cast plump with the best of British actors.

The only film character to give the Wicked Witch of the West a run for her money.\n\n\n\nStar Wars (George Lucas, 1977) Darth Vader may cast a formidable shadow, but it\'s the sound of his labored breathing that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up -- as it gets closer, closer, closer...\n\n\n\nGhostbusters (Ivan Reitman, 1984) Rule 475 of Surviving the Movies: Never go into the basement! The thick silence in New York\'s Central Library masks a phantom infestation -- and they\'re not going quietly.

{'text': 'COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN)  -- Democratic Sen. Barack Obama kicked off a series of local outreach gospel concerts Friday in Charleston, South Carolina, that unexpectedly came back to bite his campaign.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama is competing for the black vote with Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe concerts were meant to boost black voters\' support for his presidential nominee bid -- the kind of events that would normally fly under the national radar.\n\nThe ensuing controversy highlighted that Obama\'s desire to unite disparate voting blocs -- especially religious voters -- under his umbrella of "change" is not without some serious pitfalls.\n\nWhen the campaign announced the lineups for the three-city "Embrace the Change!" gospel tour last week, one name stood out to gay bloggers: Donnie McClurkin.\n\nThe Grammy-award winning singer is on record as saying homosexuality is a choice, and that he was "once involved with those desires and those thoughts" but was able to get past them through prayer.\n\nTo say the least, neither of those arguments is very popular in the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.\n\nJohn Aravosis, a prominent gay blogger and co-founder of the Web site AmericaBlog, led the charge against the Obama campaign, writing that the Illinois Democrat was "sucking up to anti-gay bigots" and "giving them a stage."\n\nWhen the story bubbled up into the mainstream media, it took the Obama campaign by surprise.\n\nObama\'s efforts in the Palmetto State have overwhelmingly targeted African-American churchgoers in a bid to win over black voters in South Carolina from rival Sen. Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe campaign has vigorously promoted the candidate\'s faith, launching "40 Days of Faith and Family" in September, which used Bible study groups to tap into the black electorate.\n\nCampaigners have run three radio ads, one of which called Obama a "Christian family man," that aired on gospel stations across the state.\n\nEarlier this month, Obama spoke at an evangelical church in the traditionally conservative city of Greenville, where he demonstrated a casual familiarity with Christian vocabulary, telling the crowd, to much applause, that "I am confident that we can create a kingdom right here on Earth."\n\nAfter that appearance, the Obama campaign told CNN that Republicans no longer had a choke hold on issues of faith and values.\n\n"I think that what you\'re seeing is a breaking down of the sharp divisions that existed maybe during the \'90s," Obama said. "At least in politics, the perception was that the Democrats were fearful of talking about faith, and on the other hand you had the Republicans who had a particular brand of faith that oftentimes seemed intolerant or pushed people away."\n\nBut on Tuesday, Obama was forced to confront the uncomfortable truth that some Christians and gays are a little more than just strange bedfellows, especially among blacks.\n\nObama issued a statement saying, "I strongly disagree with Reverend [Donnie] McClurkin\'s views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the United States," and argued that it is important to confront homophobia among religious African Americans.\n\nA September poll of African Americans in South Carolina by Winthrop University and ETV showed that 62 percent of those surveyed said that "sex between two adults of the same sex" is "strongly unacceptable."\n\nObama held a conference call Wednesday with Joe Solomonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, and announced that the Rev. Andy Sidden, an openly gay South Carolina pastor, will appear at the same event as McClurkin on Sunday in Columbia.\n\nSolomonese was not completely assuaged.\n\n"I spoke with Senator Barack Obama today and expressed to him our community\'s disappointment for his decision to continue to remain associated with Reverend McClurkin, an anti-gay preacher who states the need to \'break the curse of homosexuality,\'" he said in a statement.\n\n"There is no gospel in Donnie McClurkin\'s message for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people and their allies. That\'s a message that certainly doesn\'t belong on any presidential candidate\'s stage."\n\nThe State newspaper in Columbia reported Friday that Obama organized a conference call Thursday night with gay and lesbian leaders. After the call, the South Carolina Gay and Lesbian Pride Movement announced it will hold a protest vigil outside Sunday\'s concert in Columbia.\n\nPrivately, Obama aides say they believe Obama is a candidate of real, transformational change, and that uproars like the McClurkin controversy are necessary speed bumps on the road to bringing people with opposing viewpoints together to air their differences.\n\nWill Obama\'s refusal to kick McClurkin off the concert bill hurt him? Like many political squabbles, despite the national story, it depends how much the controversy resonates with voters in those crucial early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nAnd in South Carolina, where African Americans make up about half of Democratic primary-goers, voters might not have a problem with McClurkin at all.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama defended his patriotism Monday, telling a crowd in Independence, Missouri, that his "deep and abiding love for this country" is the reason he is running for president.\n\n\n\nSen. Barack Obama\'s speech on patriotism comes days before the Fourth of July.\n\n\n\n"At certain times over the last 16 months, I have found, for the first time, my patriotism challenged -- at times as a result of my own carelessness, more often as a result of the desire by some to score political points and raise fears and doubts about who I am and what I stand for," he said in President Harry Truman\'s hometown, just days before the Fourth of July.\n\n\n\nObama vowed to never question the patriotism of others in the campaign, adding "I will not stand idly by when I hear others question mine."\n\n\n\nObama has been defending his patriotism ever since the beginning of the primary season, when he was first criticized for not wearing a flag pin -- which he now does much more frequently -- and when false rumors began circulating that he did not say the Pledge of Allegiance.  Watch excerpts of Obama\'s speech »\n\n\n\nA widely distributed photo also seemed to show him failing to place his hand over his heart during a rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner."\n\n\n\nObama\'s wife, Michelle, also was criticized about her patriotism, after telling an audience at a campaign event, "For the first time in my adult lifetime, I\'m really proud of my country."\n\n\n\nObama\'s campaign said she was just excited about the campaign\'s grassroots support, but her words still provided fodder for her husband\'s opponents.\n\n\n\nAt his appearance Monday, Barack Obama appealed to unity. "Given the enormous challenges that lie before us, we can no longer afford these sorts of divisions," he said. "None of us expect that arguments about patriotism will, or should, vanish entirely; after all, when we argue about patriotism, we are arguing about who we are as a country, and more importantly, who we should be.\n\n\n\n"But surely, we can agree that no party or political philosophy has a monopoly on patriotism. And surely, we can arrive at a definition of patriotism that, however rough and imperfect, captures the best of America\'s common spirit."\n\n\n\nObama said that for him, "patriotism starts as a gut instinct, a loyalty and love for country that\'s rooted in some of my earliest memories."\n\n\n\nObama described how as he grew up, his patriotism matured to something that "would survive my growing awareness of our nation\'s imperfections: its ongoing racial strife; the perversion of our political system that were laid bare during the Watergate hearings; the wrenching poverty of the Mississippi Delta and the hills of Appalachia."\n\n\n\nObama said he learned that "what makes America great has never been its perfection, but the belief that it can be made better."\n\n\n\nPatriotism, he said, must involve the willingness to sacrifice. He called attention to the service of John McCain, the presumptive Republican candidate.\n\n\n\nMcCain\'s campaign has been calling on Obama to condemn comments from retired Gen. Wesley Clark, who said this weekend that McCain\'s service in Vietnam did not necessarily mean that he was qualified to serve as commander-in-chief. Read about what Clark said\n\n\n\nClark is a military adviser for Obama.\n\n\n\nIn his speech Monday, Obama did not directly address Clark\'s comments, but after calling attention to McCain\'s service, he said "no one should ever devalue that service, especially for the sake of a political campaign, and that goes for supporters of both sides."\n\n\n\n"We must always express our profound gratitude for the service of our men and women in uniform. Period," he said.\n\n\n\nJust as Obama was finishing his speech, his campaign released a statement about Clark\'s remarks.\n\n\n\n"As he\'s said many times before, Sen. Obama honors and respects Sen. McCain\'s service, and of course he rejects yesterday\'s statement by Gen. Clark," Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, McCain\'s campaign announced Monday it was launching a new Truth Squad to defend the Arizona senator\'s military record.\n\n\n\nLeaders of the latest group include McCain\'s fellow Vietnam prisoners of war Air Force Col.

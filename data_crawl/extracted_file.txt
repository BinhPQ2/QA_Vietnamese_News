{'text': '(CNN) -- Fighting in the volatile Sudanese region of Darfur has sparked another wave of refugees into Chad and left a Red Cross employee dead, according to international agencies.\n\n\n\nRefugee camps in eastern Chad house about 300,000 people who fled violence in the Darfur region of Sudan.\n\n\n\nThe U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said on Monday that more than 12,000 people have fled militia attacks over the last few days from Sudan\'s Darfur region to neighboring Chad, still recovering from a recent attempt by rebels there to topple the government.\n\n\n\n"Most of the new arrivals in Chad had already been displaced in Darfur in recent years. They are really tired of being attacked and having to move," said UNHCR\'s Jorge Holly. "All the new refugees we talked to said they did not want to go back to Darfur at this point, they wanted to be transferred to a refugee camp in eastern Chad."\n\n\n\nThis latest influx of refugees in Chad aggravates an already deteriorating security situation across this politically unstable region of Africa.\n\n\n\nBefore the latest flight into Chad, the UNHCR and its partner groups "were taking care of 240,000 Sudanese refugees in 12 camps in eastern Chad and some 50,000 from Central African Republic in the south of the country." Up to 30,000 people in Chad fled the country for Cameroon during the rebel-government fighting.\n\n\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said on Monday that one of its employees was killed in western Darfur last week during fighting. The victim is a 45-year-old Sudanese national and father of six children.\n\n\n\nHe was killed in the area of Seleia, one of the three towns where reported government-backed Janjaweed militia attacks on Friday left around 200 people dead.\n\n\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week deplored the acts, urged all parties to stop hostilities, and said "all parties must adhere to international humanitarian law, which prohibits military attacks against civilians."\n\n\n\nThe United Nations says "more than 200,000 people have been killed and 2.2 million others forced to flee their homes since fighting began in 2003 among government forces, rebel groups and allied militia groups known as the Janjaweed."\n\n\n\nThe recent fight between Chad\'s government and rebels is seen as a proxy war over Darfur.

{'text': 'Johannesburg (CNN) -- Miffed by a visa delay that led the Dalai Lama to cancel a trip to South Africa, Archbishop Desmond Tutu lashed out at his government Tuesday, saying it had acted worse than apartheid regimes and had forgotten all that the nation stood for.\n\n\n\n\n\n"When we used to apply for passports under the apartheid government, we never knew until the last moment what their decision was," Tutu said at a news conference. "Our government is worse than the apartheid government because at least you were expecting it from the apartheid government.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I have to say that I can\'t believe this. I really can\'t believe this," Tutu said. "You have to wake me up and tell me this is actually happening here."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama scrapped his planned trip to South Africa this week after the nation failed to issue him a visa in time, his spokesman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisa applications for him and his entourage were submitted to the South African High Commission in New Delhi, India, at the end of August, and original passports were submitted on September 20, more than two weeks ago, a statement on his website said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, South Africa\'s foreign affairs office said it did not refuse a visa.\n\n\n\n\n\n"South Africa will not comment on the decision, because it is not our decision, it is his decision," according to spokesman Clayson Monyela, who said the visa application was still under consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama had been invited to the country to receive the Mahatma Gandhi International Award for Peace and Reconciliation and to speak at a number of events, including a lecture in honor of Tutu\'s 80th birthday. Tutu and the Dalai Lama are recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\n\n\n\nTutu said he would pray for the defeat of South Africa\'s government, led by the African National Congress (ANC), which is rooted in the fight against the system of apartheid, or legal racial separation, that was present in South Africa until 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n"You are disgraceful," Tutu said about the government. "You are behaving in a way that is totally at variance with the things for which we stood."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ANC plans to call on government officials to explain to South Africans why the visa process was delayed, spokesman Jackson Mtembu said. He said everyone was in the dark about this matter.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he also suggested that Tutu calm down. A comparison to apartheid regimes, he said, was unfair.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not the first time the Dalai Lama has not been able to visit South Africa. In 2009, South Africa refused the Tibetan spiritual leader a visa to attend an international peace conference, saying it was not in the country\'s interest for him to attend.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn refusing the 2009 application, South Africa said that if the Dalai Lama attended the conference, the focus would shift away from the 2010 World Cup, the global soccer championship it was hosting.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We cannot allow focus to shift to China and Tibet," presidential spokesman Thabo Masebe said, adding that South Africa had gained much from its trading relationship with China.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, and China pressures governments around the world to deny him any legitimacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeculation surfaced Tuesday that this year\'s visit was also affected by South Africa\'s relationship with China.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African Vice President Kgalema Motlanthe visited Beijing last week and met with Chinese President Hu Jintao to discuss bolstering bilateral ties.\n\n\n\n\n\nMotlanthe said South Africa was ready to boost the strategic partnership between the two countries to a new stage, according to the official Chinese news agency Xinhua.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Monyela said the application had nothing to do with China.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We are a sovereign nation which takes decisions in our domestic interest," Monyela said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama posted a message on Twitter last week that said: "Even if the Chinese leave nothing but ashes, Tibet will rise from these ashes as a free country even if it takes a long time to do so."\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Norgaard, CNN\'s Johannesburg bureau chief, contributed to this report.', 'qa': [{'question': 'who did say South Africa did not issue a visa on time?', 'answers': ['his spokesman', 'Desmond Tutu', 'Archbishop Desmond Tutu']}, {'question': 'who is responsible for all this', 'answers': ['his government', 'nation failed to issue him a visa in time,', 'government.']}, {'question': 'what is the African National Congress ?', 'answers': ['which is rooted in the fight against the system of apartheid, or legal racial separation, that was present in South Africa until 1994.', 'rooted', 'which', 'fight against the system of apartheid, or legal racial separation, that was present in South Africa until 1994.']}, {'question': 'Who does the African National Congress say should calm down?', 'answers': ['Tutu']}, {'question': 'Who says the government is acting worse than apartheid regime?', 'answers': ['Archbishop Desmond Tutu']}, {'question': 'Who was denied visa to South Africa in 2009?', 'answers': ['Dalai Lama']}]}

{'text': '(CNN) -- Pope John Paul II used to beat himself with a belt and sleep on a bare floor to bring himself closer to Christ, a book published Wednesday says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe late pope had a particular belt for self-flagellation and brought it with him to his summer residence, according to the book, "Why he is a Saint: The True story of John Paul II."\n\n\n\n\n\n"As some members of his own entourage were able to hear with their own ears, both in Poland and in the Vatican, Karol Wojtyla flagellated himself," the book says, using the name the pope was given at birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n"In the closet, among the cloaks, a particular pant-belt hung from a hook, which he utilized as a whip and one which he always had brought to Castel Gandolfo," the book says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe book was written by a Vatican insider, Slawomir Oder, with Italian journalist Saverio Gaeta of the Catholic weekly Christian Family. Oder is head of the Vatican committee investigating whether John Paul II should be declared a saint. John Paul died in 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe evil albino monk in Dan Brown\'s "The Da Vinci Code" may be the best-known example of self-flagellation these days, but the practice is not unusual in Catholicism -- or nearly as extreme as it is shown in the movie.\n\n\n\n\n\n"When members or former members [of Opus Dei] see the monk go at it in the movie, they just burst out laughing, it\'s so nutty," said the Rev. Michael Barrett, a priest of the Catholic Opus Dei sect.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn actual Catholic self-flagellation, "there is no blood, no injury, nothing to harm a person\'s health, nothing traumatic. If it caused any harm, the Church would not allow it," he wrote on Opus Dei\'s Web site when the movie came out in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\n"This voluntarily accepted discomfort is a way of joining oneself to Jesus Christ and the sufferings he voluntarily accepted in order to redeem us from sin. \'The Da Vinci Code\'s\' masochist monk, who loves pain for its own sake, has nothing to do with real Christian mortification," Barrett said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMother Teresa is among famous Catholics who self-flagellated in some way, Barrett said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholics are not alone in choosing to inflict pain on themselves for religion reasons. Some Shiite Muslims lash themselves until they bleed when marking the mourning period of Ashura, while fasting is practiced by people in several religions, including Jews on Yom Kippur, the day of atonement.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Gibson, a journalist who worked for Vatican Radio when John Paul II was pope, pointed out that the pontiff wrote an apostolic letter -- essentially a papal position paper -- on suffering in 1984.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Christ did not conceal from his listeners the need for suffering. He said very clearly: \'If any man would come after me ... let him take up his cross daily,\' " the pope wrote, quoting the Gospel of Luke.\n\n\n\n\n\nJesus, the pope wrote, "suffered in place of man and for man. Every man has his own share in the Redemption. Each one is also called to share in that suffering through which the Redemption was accomplished.\n\n\n\n\n\n"In bringing about the Redemption through suffering, Christ has also raised human suffering to the level of the Redemption. Thus each man, in his suffering, can also become a sharer in the redemptive suffering of Christ," says the letter, Salvifici Doloris, On the Christian Meaning of Human Suffering.\n\n\n\n\n\n"John Paul was a product of a very Old World Polish Catholicism," said Gibson, who now writes on religion for Politics Daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n"He was a very disciplined man and a very rigorous man in his personal spirituality," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authors of the new book clearly approve of any whipping the pope did of himself, he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Even though it\'s going to weird people out, it\'s obviously seen by his postulators as a sign of his holiness," he said, using the technical term for the person who investigates a person\'s qualifications for sainthood.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the idea is not as bizarre as it might sound to contemporary ears.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The idea of fasting, renouncing something, giving up your Starbucks latte so you can send money to Haiti -- you can\'t simply look down your nose at it without rejecting a lot of other ideas about self-sacrifice," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authors of the book based it on interviews with 114 "witnesses" and access to unedited documents in the Vatican\'s archives, according to the publisher, Rizzoli.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe book is available only in Italian, but the publisher is having it translated into Polish and other languages.', 'qa': [{'question': 'what Pope used to beat himself?', 'answers': ['John Paul II']}, {'question': 'who "a particular pant-belt" to beat himself, book says?', 'answers': ['Pope', 'John Paul II']}, {'question': 'who says "Why he is a Saint: The True story of John Paul II"?', 'answers': ['Slawomir Oder,']}, {'question': 'what Journalist compares flagellation to fasting or other?', 'answers': ['David Gibson,', 'Slawomir Oder,']}, {'question': 'what did he do', 'answers': ['used to beat himself with a belt and sleep on a bare floor', 'beat himself with a belt and sleep on', 'closer to Christ,', 'floor to bring himself']}, {'question': 'there John Paul II slept?', 'answers': ['bare floor']}, {'question': 'what pope is this', 'answers': ['John Paul II']}, {'question': 'when John Paul wrot a apostolic letter on suffering?', 'answers': ['1984.']}]}

{'text': 'TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran\'s parliament speaker has criticized U.S. President-elect Barack Obama for saying that Iran\'s development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable.\n\nIranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has outlined where he thinks U.S. policy needs to change.\n\nAli Larijani said Saturday that Obama should apply his campaign message of change to U.S. dealings with Iran.\n\n"Obama must know that the change that he talks about is not simply a superficial changing of colors or tactics," Larijani said in comments carried by the semi-official Mehr News Agency.\n\n"What is expected is a change in strategy, not the repetition of objections to Iran\'s nuclear program, which will be taking a step in the wrong direction."\n\nIn his first post-election news conference Friday afternoon, Obama reiterated that he believes a nuclear-armed Iran would be "unacceptable." He also said he would help mount an international effort to prevent it from happening.\n\nLarijani said that U.S. behavior toward Iran "will not change so simply" but that Obama\'s election showed internal conditions in the United States have shifted.\n\nHe added that Iran does not mind if the United States provides other Persian Gulf countries with nuclear technology, but "you should know that you cannot prevent the Islamic Republic [from reaching its goals in the nuclear field]," according to the news agency.\n\nObama cautioned Friday that it had only been a few days since the election and that he was not in office.\n\n"Obviously, how we approach and deal with a country like Iran is not something that we should simply do in a knee-jerk fashion. I think we\'ve got to think it through," Obama said.\n\n"But I have to reiterate once again that we only have one president at a time. And I want to be very careful that we are sending the right signals to the world as a whole that I am not the president, and I won\'t be until January 20th."\n\nLarijani was speaking two days after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad congratulated Obama, the first time an Iranian leader has offered such wishes to a U.S. president-elect since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nOne analyst said the welcome was a gesture from the hard-line president that he is open to a more conciliatory relationship with the United States.\n\nAhmadinejad said Tehran "welcomes basic and fair changes in U.S. policies and conducts," according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency on Thursday.\n\nRelations between the United States and Iran have historically been chilly and have been further strained in recent years over Iran\'s nuclear program.\n\nTehran insists that the program exists for peaceful purposes, but the United States and other Western nations are concerned by Iran\'s refusal to halt uranium enrichment activities.\n\nCNN\'s Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.', 'qa': [{'question': 'Iran criticizes who?', 'answers': ['U.S. President-elect Barack Obama', 'President-elect Barack Obama']}, {'question': 'What are US and Iran relations tensioned about?', 'answers': ['development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable.', 'nuclear program.']}, {'question': 'Who said Obama should apply campaign message?', 'answers': ['Ali Larijani']}, {'question': 'What should Obama apply according to speaker?', 'answers': ['his campaign message of change', 'U.S. dealings with Iran.', 'Ali Larijani']}, {'question': 'US - Iran tensions are high over what?', 'answers': ['nuclear weapon', 'development', 'nuclear program.']}, {'question': 'Who was the President of the US at this time?', 'answers': ['Barack Obama', 'Larijani', 'Mahmoud Ahmadinejad']}, {'question': "Who has tensions over Tehran's nuclear ambitions?", 'answers': ['U.S.', 'program, which will be taking a step in the wrong direction."', 'the United States', '"What is expected is a change in strategy, not the repetition of objections to Iran\'s']}, {'question': 'Who criticized Obama ?', 'answers': ["Iran's parliament speaker"]}, {'question': 'Parliamentary speaker says who should apply campaign message of change?', 'answers': ['of', 'to U.S. dealings with Iran.', 'U.S. President-elect Barack Obama', 'Obama', 'Ali Larijani said Saturday that Obama', 'his']}, {'question': 'What kind of weapons are being discussed?', 'answers': ['nuclear']}, {'question': 'Who criticized Obama for saying nuclear weapon development is unaccaptable?', 'answers': ['Ali Larijani', "Iran's parliament speaker", 'parliament speaker']}, {'question': 'What basic reason is there for US-Iranian tensions to be high?', 'answers': ['nuclear program,', 'nuclear technology,']}]}
{'text': '(CNN) -- Jewish organizations called for a Romanian official to resign and face a criminal investigation after he wore a Nazi uniform during a fashion show over the weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nRadu Mazare, the mayor of the town of Constanta, wore a Nazi uniform during a fashion show over the weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nRadu Mazare, the mayor of the town of Constanta, and his 15-year-old son "entered the stage marching the clearly identifiable Nazi \'goose step,\'" the Center for Monitoring and Combating anti-Semitism in Romania said in a letter to the country\'s prosecutor general.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organization\'s director, Marco Katz, said Mazare had broken Romanian law and encouraged his son to do the same, "educating him to treat the law with contempt."\n\n\n\n\n\nKatz said Mazare was sending a message "that to wear Nazi uniforms and to march the Nazi steps is legal and \'in vogue\' in Romania."\n\n\n\n\n\nHe urged the authorities and the head of Mazare\'s Social Democrat party to show that message "will be strongly countermanded."\n\n\n\n\n\nMazare, 41, said he had not noticed the Nazi swastika symbol on the uniform before he wore it, according to the Romanian Times newspaper.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I checked it before I put it on but the swastika was very small and I didn\'t see it," he said.

Zuroff sent CNN a copy of the letter.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said it was no defense that the uniform was that of the Wehrmacht -- the army -- rather than the SS, the elite Nazi guard which took the lead in killing Jews during the Holocaust.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The Wehrmacht played an active role in the mass murder of European Jewry and many other innocent victims. By dressing in a Wehrmacht uniform, you are expressing totally unwarranted support and nostalgia for an army which committed the most terrible war crimes and acts of genocide," the letter said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It would hard to adequately describe the depth of the pain that your appearance caused, not only to Jews and other victims of Nazism, but to any person of moral integrity who knows the history of World War II," Zuroff wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\nZuroff told CNN he did not expect Mazare to resign, or even to respond to the letter.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he said he hoped the mayor might act on Zuroff\'s suggestion that Mazare create a Romanian-language edition of an acclaimed exhibition on the crimes of the Wehrmacht.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nazi uniform incident, which took place Sunday, was the first time Zuroff heard of Mazare, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"He has a history of being outrageous, but his antics have never included something that I would deal with," Zuroff said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"He\'s a real character, apparently.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A phone hacking scandal may have cost Rupert Murdoch his biggest-selling newspaper in 2011, but the billionaire media mogul managed to end the year with a modest addition to his empire -- an account on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin 48 hours of debuting with tweets about family, work and politics, Murdoch had pulled in more than 45,000 followers and stirred internet debate over why the 80-year-old was now embracing a technology often used to attack him.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tweets also raised doubts that the notorious technophobe was writing the messages himself. Twitter creator Jack Dorsey -- one of only four people being followed by Murdoch -- however insisted that the media mogul was writing "with his own voice, in his own way."\n\n\n\n\n\nMurdoch appears to have made his Twitter debut on New Year\'s Eve with a couple of brief comments on books including the biography of late Apple boss Steve Jobs, which he called "interesting but unfair."\n\n\n\n\n\nThese were followed by praise for cinema releases "We Bought a Zoo," and "The Descendants," both produced by Murdoch\'s Fox Movies. These fueled suspicions that Murdoch\'s Twitter account was being used as a publicity tool to help improve his image after a damaging year.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Could be brilliant News Corp PR operation," Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff tweeted after earlier commenting: "Might be somebody who knows Murdoch, but it\'s not Rupert (he doesn\'t use a computer unassisted nor get his own email)."\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers claimed that the voice of the tweets, as well as their faltering grammar and punctuation, were unmistakably Murdoch. "You can tell by the tweets he\'s doing it himself," wrote CNN\'s Piers Morgan, a former editor of one of Murdoch\'s newspapers.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Murdoch\'s News Corp. confirmed to CNN the account is genuine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe account could offer new insight into a businessman whose life has been under intense scrutiny this year after revelations that journalists at News of the World, one of his most profitable newspapers, illegally accessed the voicemail messages of scores of celebrities and public figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter played a prominent role at the height of the scandal when it was used to pressure advertisers into boycotting the paper. Commentators said the loss of revenue was a key factor in Murdoch\'s decision to shut the paper down.\n\n\n\n\n\nMurdoch\'s subsequent appearance before a British parliamentary inquiry into phone hacking also caused a sensation on Twitter, particularly after his wife, Wendi Deng, pounced on a man who tried to attack him with a foam pie.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were echoes of Murdoch\'s parliamentary appearance -- which he called the "most humble day day of my life" -- in New Year pledges which he tweeted in a January 1 message to Dorsey. "My resolutions, try to maintain humility and always curiosity. And of course diet!"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there were also signs that the media mogul was still getting to grips with social media. Reports suggested he was forced to quickly delete one post -- possibly after Deng leapt to his aid once again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald -- a fierce rival of his Australian publications -- was among news outlets claiming that Murdoch was guilty of "tweeting-before-thinking" for suggesting that the British have too many holidays for a "broke country."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe message was apparently removed, but not before someone tweeting as Wendi Deng implored: "RUPERT!!! delete tweet!" A further post on the unverified Deng account later added: "EVERY1 @rupertmurdoch was only having a joke pROMSIE!!!" [sic]\n\n\n\n\n\nMurdoch also follows an account that appears on the surface to be Google CEO Larry Page but is actually run by a man in Virginia. It\'s not clear whether Murdoch realizes he\'s not following the real Larry Page.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong other tweets by Murdoch, who also follows Zynga CEO Mark Pincus and Silcon Valley entrepreneur and British businessman Alan Sugar, were an expression of support for Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum.', 'qa': [{'question': 'How many followers does Rupert have?', 'answers': ['45,000']}, {'question': 'How many followers does Murdoch have on twitter?', 'answers': ['45,000']}, {'question': 'What do his tweets talk about?', 'answers': ['family, work', 'politics,', 'family, work and politics,']}, {'question': 'What is his age?', 'answers': ['80-year-old']}, {'question': 'what age is the person?', 'answers': ['80-year-old']}, {'question': 'What types of tweets does Murdoch write?', 'answers': ['about family, work and politics,', 'family, work and politics,']}, {'question': 'Which news channel was this information confirmed to?', 'answers': ['CNN']}, {'question': 'What is number of followers Murdoch has?', 'answers': ['45,000', 'more than 45,000']}]}
{'text': 'ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Jeremy Piven is the kind of guy who can make you laugh just by lifting an eyebrow.\n\n\n\nJeremy Piven stars as a used car salesman in "The Goods." He says "Entourage" would make a great film.\n\n\n\nOf course, the popular actor can do much more than that to captivate audiences.\n\n\n\nFrom drama to comedy, Piven has starred in more than 40 films on the big screen and has won critical acclaim for his role as super agent Ari Gold on HBO\'s "Entourage." (HBO, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.)\n\n\n\nPiven stopped by the CNN.com newsroom to talk with CNN\'s Nicole Lapin about his new film, "The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard," in which he plays a used car salesman.\n\n\n\nThe following is an edited version of the interview:\n\n\n\nCNN: [The movie] was hysterical, and my producer and I were sitting next to each other and we were trying to figure out -- is this like lowbrow, but it\'s smart, so it\'s medium-brow? Highbrow comedy?\n\n\n\nJeremy Piven: It\'s a hybrid-brow, or a unibrow. It\'s from the people who brought you "Talladega Nights" and "Step Brothers" and "Anchorman," so from the kings of guys who make really smart, low-brow comedies, and I\'m just insanely honored to be a part of it.\n\n\n\nIt\'s like a dream because my fear was that by the time Will [Ferrell] hit the screen that, worst-case scenario, the movie wouldn\'t be funny enough. So that when Will jumps out of the plane, he takes us to a whole other level -- it\'s like, "Oh my God, Will Ferrell is so brilliant." But the reality is, the movie was so funny up until that moment that it was really, it was kind of organic, and it sustained it and it was really fantastic.  Watch why part of Piven\'s interview had to be bleeped out »\n\n\n\nJames Brolin would go home to his wife, Barbra Streisand, at night, and I would say, "James, is she OK with all this?" Because he has one of the most twisted roles you\'ve ever seen, as you know -- and I don\'t want to give it away. He was like, "Well, the wife is on the fence about this whole thing," and she came to a screening and I swear to God, Babs laughed the loudest.\n\n\n\nCNN: I think that\'s a tease in itself. That would probably get people to see it.\n\n\n\nPiven: Yes, I think you\'re right. The movie is OK\'d by Barbra Streisand; she vetted the whole thing.\n\n\n\nIf you would have told me, I would be doing a lead in a movie, and Will Ferrell would have a smaller role in it, I never would have believed you, but I\'m here to tell you anything is possible.\n\n\n\nCNN: Anything is possible, even in some 40 some movies in your career, but this is the first lead in a while, I mean did it take you a while to get into the used car salesman character?\n\n\n\nPiven: There\'s a great documentary called "Slasher" about car salesmen that I took a look at, and I went to a bunch of lots, and I\'ve also been sold a lot of cars, and I\'m what\'s known as a sucker.\n\n\n\nAs soon as they see me coming in, they know they\'re going to take my money. So I kind of took that, and I reversed it and I\'m no longer a sucker.\n\n\n\nCNN: Are you going to stick with "Entourage"?\n\n\n\nPiven: Well, I think "Entourage" ... this season is the sixth season, and it\'s I think the most interesting of all of them, and I kind of have the best arc this year.\n\n\n\nThe backstage life of Hollywood is such fertile stuff for our show that I think we could continue on for as long as it stays fresh.\n\n\n\nCNN: What about a movie?\n\n\n\nPiven: I think a movie would be really, really fun of "Entourage."

{'text': 'Berlin, Germany (CNN)  -- A bomb scare that affected about 100 flights at Munich Airport in Germany on Wednesday may have been a false alarm, German police told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice launched a huge manhunt Wednesday after a passenger appeared to flee from security officers when his laptop computer bag tested positive for explosives, they said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice originally said authorities wanted to take the man in for further testing after his bag set off suspicions, but he ran. They said a bomb squad was testing the bag to see if it really contained explosives.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut authorities later said the man may simply have been in a hurry, grabbed his things and left the airport.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey do not have the laptop case, they said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are still trying to find the man, they said, but are no longer describing the search as a huge manhunt.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice earlier said they were reviewing airport security videos to try to figure out where the man went.

{'text': 'SAVANNAH, Georgia (CNN)  -- What does it really take to dress someone as fashion-forward and in the spotlight as Michelle Obama?\n\n\n\nDesigner Yigal Azrouël talks with students at the Savannah College of Art and Design.\n\n\n\n"Bravery," says Isabel Toledo, designer of the first lady\'s attention-grabbing lemongrass yellow wool and lace ensemble that she wore for the inauguration of her husband President Obama.\n\n\n\nBut along with bravery about their fashion sense, new graduates at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) will need courage in the face of the current recession.\n\n\n\n"Fashion is being hit particularly hard in the new job market. Fashion as a whole is feeling a greater level of lost revenues and in turn has lost opportunities for sustaining volume and even more so for growth," said Marshal Cohen, chief analyst and expert fashion analyst for the NPD market research group.\n\n\n\n"The ironic thing is that new ideas and creations are just what the industry needs but is too cautious to react to it," he added.\n\n\n\nFull of new ideas, student designers say they are aware of the challenges as they head out into the work force, but they\'re optimistic they can make it in these tough times.\n\n\n\n"After I graduate, I\'m going to New York, I have an internship lined up with a trend forecasting company, Promostyl," said Shelby Simon whose designs made it into SCAD\'s annual fashion show.

She would like to land an internship in New York and has interviewed with New York & Co. and applied for positions at Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein and Zac Posen.\n\n\n\nToledo, a world-renown designer, knows it can be tough to make it in fashion. She and her fashion illustrator husband Ruben Toledo didn\'t have much money when they arrived from Cuba in the late 60s as political refugees. She says she found inspiration in the little things.  Experts\' advice on getting to top of fashion business »\n\n\n\n"Go out there and look at things, look at things well. Study them; the smallest things can inspire you. That will make you able to do what you want on any level. Many times kids think you have to have all this backing coming into a big industry. I didn\'t do that, I started from the bottom and as a matter of fact you can only go up," said Isabel Toledo.\n\n\n\nToledo was at the school last weekend to accept the 2009 André Leon Talley Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n\n\nBut for six months, two other top designers, Yigal Azrouël and Lars Nilsson, have been mentoring and critiquing 23 students to help them develop their designs for the runway.\n\n\n\nAzrouël, a self-taught designer, says it\'s a tough industry and students have to pay their dues.\n\n\n\n"It\'s not what people think it is or what it looks like from the outside. If you want to be a fashion designer you have to carry fabric on your back, you need to learn how to cut and sew. The fame is going to come later."\n\n\n\nMore known for his expert draping techniques, Yigal Azrouël taught students more than how to incorporate intricate folds and pleats in their designs.\n\n\n\n"If you love something, go ahead and do it, but, be very consistent with it," advised Azrouël.\n\n\n\nSCAD senior Caitlin Clarke says working with Nilsson really helped her create new silhouettes and structured angles with interesting seams.\n\n\n\n"Lars was so helpful. I remember this one time when he came in and said \'Ah, there\'s something not right with this dress\' and then he helped me cut it up and fix it," said Clarke.\n\n\n\nNilsson enjoyed the process.\n\n\n\n"I really tried to spend a lot of time seeing what they [the students] had to say, giving them advice and push them forward to express themselves," said Nilsson. "It\'s been a great collaboration, and I must say that I\'ve learned a lot myself, too."\n\n\n\nThe visiting designers give the students an edge in their job search, says SCAD president Paula Wallace. "It\'s very important to bring in the top professionals because they inspire the students and they provide contacts and networking for the students after they graduate."\n\n\n\nStudents are also using social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and MySpace to reach out to their peers and other industry professionals. In order to succeed you have to have innovative approaches to market, sell and sustain your product lines, said retail analyst Hitha Prabhakar.\n\n\n\nRight now retailers are in "survival of the fittest" mode and a handful of designers including Mui Mui, Allessandro Del Acqua, Allegra Hicks and Krizia have had to shut their store doors on Madison Avenue, she said.\n\n\n\nSCAD senior Shelby Simon feels some students went into fashion because they like to shop, but she warns there is so much more to learn about the craft..\n\n\n\n"The truth is hard work, nose to the grind stone and learning.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Les Paul never stopped tinkering, said Henry Juszkiewicz.\n\n\n\nLes Paul was constantly making recommendations on how to improve guitars, says the CEO of Gibson.\n\n\n\nJuszkiewicz, the chairman and CEO of Gibson Guitars, remembers getting calls from his company\'s partner (and famed client), offering recommendations on how to change or market his eponymous Gibson guitars.\n\n\n\nSometimes, Juszkiewicz recalls, the two would go out for Chinese food. Paul was very particular, desiring a dish called Chicken Subgum. The two would have to search Chinatown for a restaurant that knew how to cook it, he says with a chuckle.\n\n\n\nLes Paul died Thursday of pneumonia. He was 94.\n\n\n\nJuszkiewicz talked about his friend and colleague Thursday afternoon. The following is an edited version of the interview.  Watch how Les Paul helped invent modern music »\n\n\n\nCNN: Tell me about working with Les Paul.\n\n\n\nHenry Juszkiewicz: I\'ve been with Gibson about 25 years and known Les pretty much through that entire period. ... Les was a very kind person. He was a visionary.\n\n\n\nIn the early days, Gibson was doing very poorly as a company, and I got involved essentially to turn the company around. ... We had many, many conversations about the guitar business and what to do. ... A lot of the things we talked about and implemented were very successful.\n\n\n\nCNN: What was distinctive about the Gibson Les Paul when it came out, and what remains distinctive about it?  Gallery: Guitarists pay tribute to Les Paul »\n\n\n\nJuszkiewicz: When it first came out, it was extremely controversial, and it was not really successful. It took years for Gibson to actually come to terms with Les. He had been pitching the head of what was Gibson\'s parent company, CMI, for three or four years until they finally decided to give it a try -- and only then when he became very famous and a television personality.\n\n\n\nAnd they were right, actually, because a solid-body guitar was considered silly. ... It really wasn\'t until 1965, \'66 that the guitar took off and became popular. In fact, in the early \'60s, the guitar was discontinued for several years. One of the [prized] Les Pauls was the 1959 Les Paul -- that\'s sort of the holy grail of Les Pauls -- and one of the reasons is there were only 300 units made in 1959. And 300 units was not really that successful for Gibson; it was a powerhouse guitar builder in 1959.\n\n\n\nSo Les was always ahead of his time. He was someone who could see what was going to happen 50 years in advance, and very often, he was able to bring his vision to reality and share it with the entire musical community. ...\n\n\n\nThe [Les Paul] guitar shines in modern music. ... In the \'50s and before the \'50s, the [standard] guitar was amplified, but it was just louder. In other words, it still sounded just like an acoustic guitar, but you could turn it up. What Les did was turn it into a whole new instrument. When he was playing ... you will hear this rich context that\'s kind of normal today. ...\n\n\n\nCNN: Les Paul being Les Paul, I assumed he continue to play with things over the years.\n\n\n\nJuszkiewicz: Yeah, he would call me all the time and give me suggestions. It\'s really hard to answer your original question, what makes it [distinctive]. ... As a guitar player, when I pick it up, I know it\'s a Les Paul. I can feel the sustain. It\'s got a certain feeling. ... There\'s a lot of things in it. But it\'s the package that\'s kind of magic. In the modern world, working with modern equipment, it\'s incomparable.\n\n\n\nCNN: How many Les Pauls do you sell nowadays?\n\n\n\nJuszkiewicz: A lot. Many, many thousands.\n\n\n\nI\'ll share with you: We had a big debate when we first got involved in the business. When I was a young guitar player, Les Pauls were always very expensive ... and they\'re very expensive today. [Paul] said, "You know, Henry, you really have to make a less expensive Les Paul." ... We argued about it for a year and a half, and finally I gave in. I said, "OK, Les, it\'s your guitar." ...\n\n\n\nAnd it was an instant success. And all of a sudden, people that couldn\'t touch that magic got a shot at it, and he was pleased as punch, and we were as well.\n\n\n\nHe was a renaissance man. ... What a life.

{'text': 'United Nations (CNN) -- Confronted with the prospect of a Palestinian bid for full U.N. membership, U.S. President Barack Obama issued a sharp rebuke Wednesday to those pressing for statehood -- a rebuke likely to bring criticism from the Arab world.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the U.N.," Obama said, addressing delegates at the 66th annual session of U.N. General Assembly. "If it were that easy, it would have been accomplished by now."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States has vowed to block a Palestinian membership application should it reach the Security Council, but is likely eager to head off a scenario that would involve an American veto -- a move widely seen as unpopular across the Middle East.\n\n\n\n\n\nA formal request for full U.N. membership is expected to be submitted Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n"One year ago, I stood at this podium and called for an independent Palestine," Obama added. "I believed then -- and I believe now -- that the Palestinian people deserve a state of their own. But what I also said is that genuine peace can only be realized between Israelis and Palestinians themselves."\n\n\n\n\n\nA year later, despite extensive U.S. efforts, "the parties have not bridged their differences," Obama said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American president met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and declared the bonds between their two countries "unbreakable," a move likely to play well at home in an increasingly volatile U.S. political landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough Netanyahu was not in attendance at the General Assembly during Obama\'s speech, he called the U.S. position a "badge of honor," and has pushed for a resumption of talks, beginning in New York and continuing in Ramallah and Jerusalem.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeace negotiations broke down last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas met with Obama later Wednesday, part of a whirlwind of diplomatic wrangling that has accompanied his proposed move. Obama reiterated his stance on the need for a two-state solution, officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbas met earlier with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who promised the request would be taken "very seriously," according to Nabeel Shaath, a senior negotiator for the Palestine Liberation Organization. Shaath told CNN it had not been decided if the formal application would be submitted the U.N. secretary-general before or after Abbas addresses the General Assembly early Friday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nBan said it will "not take long" to get Security Council consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\nShaath added that settling for a lesser status -- such as being recognized as a non-member state -- is one option under consideration if the push for full membership is blocked. But the Palestinians do not want "anybody to suspect a lack of seriousness," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestinians\' current status at the United Nations is as an observer "entity." Observers can speak in the General Assembly but not vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile a veto by the United States in the Security Council would block any effort to gain full U.N. membership, a "yes" vote in the General Assembly -- where only a majority would be needed -- would raise Palestinians to the status of permanent observer "state," the status the Vatican currently holds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbas\' effort to gain U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state is opposed by Hamas, the Palestinian organization that controls Gaza. It has warned Abbas against making the request, saying it would show a willingness to acknowledge and negotiate with Israel, which would "deprive the Palestinian people from their right to come back to their homeland."\n\n\n\n\n\nAs national leaders took to rostrum Wednesday to spell out their visions for global peace and security, attention at the U.N. General Assembly seemed to center on the potential membership bid.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy urged the body to recognize Palestine as a non-member state, calling for a more definitive timetable for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. But he also warned that a U.S. veto of the bid for full membership in the Security Council could be dangerous and might spark violence.\n\n\n\n\n\nArgentinean President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner seemed to agree, adding that "non-inclusion of Palestine (at the United Nations) this year will create greater insecurity."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Palestinian leader said he will personally deliver the application to the U.N. Security Council, but does not expect the body to act immediately, according to Palestinian officials.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey say Abbas is expected to deliver the letter before he leaves New York on Friday, but added that he will give both the United Nations and American leadership several weeks to respond to the letter -- temporarily averting a diplomatic showdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbas will wait for a response from the diplomatic Quartet on the Middle East, the officials said, and then return to the U.N. General Assembly to negotiate statehood recognition, working through the U.N. Security Council.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbas\' goal, according to the officials, is to legitimize Palestinian statehood by eventually forcing a vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff, who kicked off the opening round of speeches at the assembly\'s 66th session, joined the chorus of voices on Wednesday calling on the council to approve the Palestinian bid.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer speech marked the first time a woman has commenced the annual proceeding, reflecting a moment of equality at the start of what she described as "the century of women."\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Wednesday, Obama pressed Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan --- an increasingly vocal critic of Israel -- to continue work toward patching up their strained relationship, officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.N. chief, meanwhile, also focused on a series of other issues highlighted during the annual session, particularly the spread of noncommunicable diseases, empowering women, food security and climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth -- these are one and the same fight," said Ban. "Today, I call on you to reach a binding climate change agreement -- an agreement with more ambitious national and global emissions targets."\n\n\n\n\n\nThirty-one of the world body\'s 193 delegates are expected to address the assembly this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazil has traditionally opened the session since the days of former American president Harry Truman, when the U.N. was in its infancy. It was founded in 1945 after World War II.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Elise Labott, Richard Roth, Alan Silverleib and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What did the French president say?', 'answers': ['urged the body to recognize Palestine as a non-member state, calling for a more definitive timetable for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

{'text': '(CNN Student News)  -- Discussion Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n1. When is Black History Month observed? When did Black History Month get its start? Who was Dr. Carter G. Woodson? What was his role in the establishment of Black History Month?\n\n\n\n\n\n2. What are some significant events and milestones in U.S. black history? Who are some of the individuals who have contributed to black history?\n\n\n\n\n\n3. How does black history help to tell the story of what it means to be an American? How have African-Americans enriched that story? What lessons can be learned from the experiences of black history makers?\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activities\n\n\n\n\n\nUse these activities to encourage your students to learn about and appreciate the history, culture and achievements of African-Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. A Milestone in U.S. History\n\n\n\n\n\nRemind students that they have witnessed a truly historical event in their lifetime: the election of Barack Obama as the first African-American president. What will they remember about this milestone? What do they want future generations to know about it? Challenge students to write letters to students who will be in their place 100 years from now, describing the event and its significance for all Americans. Combine the letters into a book or a Web site, or create a video of students reading their letters. Present the finished product to your school\'s historian or media specialist for archiving.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Covering Black History\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk students: What if CNN correspondents had been on the scene to record key moments in black history for the entire world to see? Organize students into small teams of reporters, and have each team select a time period in American history and a key figure or event that helped to define that time period for African-Americans. Then, have students imagine that CNN was there to cover the historical figure or event. Ask: How do you think that CNN reporters might have covered these stories? Encourage the teams to write scripts for news stories on their historical figures and events. After students have presented their scripts, have them compare their reports to eyewitness accounts and local newspaper reports that were written at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Harlem Renaissance\n\n\n\n\n\nInform students that during the 1920s and 1930s, an African-American cultural movement occurred in the United States that was known as the Harlem Renaissance. It was a literary, musical and artistic explosion that was born in Harlem, New York, and it had a profound impact on African-American culture and on the U.S. as a whole. Have your class host a Harlem Renaissance cultural fair. Direct students to online resources to learn about some of the great artists, writers and musicians who were part of the renaissance and their contribution to this cultural movement.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave each student select one of these African-American artists and design a display that tells about the life and times of the artist and the importance of his or her work. Invite guests from your school and community to attend the exhibit. Have students serve as "roaming curators" to instruct and interest guests in the Harlem Renaissance and the creative works of these great African-Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Profiles in Black History\n\n\n\n\n\nDo your students show a personal interest in science, music, politics, theater, sports or education? Inspire them to celebrate the contributions of African-Americans by having them write profiles of African-Americans in the categories that interest them. For example, a budding young scientist might choose to profile the inventor of the ironing board, the lawn mower or the space shuttle retrieval arm, all of whom were/are African-Americans. Direct your students to online and print resources and have them conduct research on their chosen individuals. Then, encourage students to write proposals to have their selected persons commemorated in new postage stamps. Students should accompany their proposals with designs for the stamps. In their presentations, students should try to convince classmates why their profiled persons should have a stamp created in their name. Post the designs around the classroom.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Local African-American History\n\n\n\n\n\nValuable lessons in black history may be found just a few steps away in the stories and documents that can be found in local libraries, historical organizations, universities or colleges, and online. Encourage students to venture out into the community to investigate the history and contributions of black Americans in their city or town. Students might choose to use milestones in black history as a way to organize their research, gathering information on how those events impacted the community and its residents. They may also decide to profile influential black community members. Have students invite community members to a celebration of local black history.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Black History Museum\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrate black history by creating plans for a local Black History Museum. First, have students decide where the museum should be housed. Suggestions might include a school or local library, an exhibit in an existing history museum, or perhaps a virtual online museum. Next, discuss how the museum should be organized. Students may choose to categorize the content by theme, by specific time periods, by specific dates, by people or by local landmarks. Encourage students to include interactive elements and multimedia in their plans. Then, challenge students to consider what people, events or contributions to include in their Black History Museum. Ask: What messages or lessons do you want visitors to take away from the exhibits?\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Not Just for February\n\n\n\n\n\nInform students that, while Dr. Carter G. Woodson chose the month of February to recognize the accomplishments of African-Americans, black history can be celebrated all year long. Challenge students to create year-long calendars or timelines that highlight the contributions of African-American newsmakers, illustrate key events in black history, and encourage an ongoing celebration of black culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nStandards\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Studies\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Time, Continuity, and Change\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of the ways human beings view themselves in and over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nV.

{'text': "(CNN) -- Two goals in five minutes at the start of extra-time helped defending champions Egypt book their place in the African Nations Cup semifinals with a battling 3-1 victory over Cameroon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game, though, was marred by a controversial third goal by midfielder Ahmed Hassan which was allowed to stand by referee Jerome Damon despite replays showing the ball had clearly not crossed the line.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy that time the Pharaohs' captain, who was winning a record 170th cap for his country, had already scored an own goal to put the Indomitable Lions ahead after 26 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nHassan scored again at the other end to pull his side level with a powerful long-range strike before half-time which eventually forced the game into an additional 30 minutes in Benguela.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstitute Mohamed Gedo then capitalized on an error from Geremi Njitap to put Egypt ahead in extra-time, before Hassan's controversial strike handed them a two-goal cushion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make matters worse for Paul Le Guen's Cameroon, Aurelien Chedjou was sent off late on as the north Africans set up a tantalising last-four clash with old foes Algeria.\n\n\n\n\n\nCameroon took the lead following a spell of intense pressure. A succession of Achille Emana corners had the Egyptian defence wobbling -- and the seventh one resulted in Hassan's weak-header on the line dropping into his own net.\n\n\n\n\n\nCameroon pressed for a second goal but were taken by surprise when Hassan unleashed a fierce 35-yard strike in the 37th minute that deceived goalkeeper Carlos Kameni before finding its way in.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmad Moteab could have won the game for Egypt right at the death after he was picked out at the back post by a sweeping pass from Hassan, but the Al-Ahly forward could only find the side netting as the game entered extra-time.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Hassan Shehata's side wasted no time in killing off the tie going 3-1 up after 95 minutes -- after being gifted both goals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first came  when Geremi's poor back-pass from the right was intercepted by Gedo, who and tucked away with ease through the legs of Kameni two minutes after the resumption.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second seems certain to land South African referee Damon in the spotlight after Hassan's free-kick from the left was pushed onto the underside of the crossbar by the Espanyol goalkeeper and did not cross the line when it hit the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it was still allowed to stand much to the dismay of the Cameroon players. It also seemed to knock the stuffing out of Le Guen's men as they failed to create any major openings in the closing 25 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add insult to injury, Chedjou was shown a straight red for hauling down last-man Gedo midway through the second period of extra-time with Egypt going on to seal a memorable win.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria became the fourth team to reach the semifinals after defeating Zambia in a dull final quarterfinal showdown in Lubango.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeither side could find the net after 90 minutes and 30 minutes of extra time, but Nigeria progressed 5-4 on penalties and will now face near-neighbors Ghana in the last four on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoalkeeper Vincent Enyeama scored the decisive penalty for Nigeria after Thomas Nyirenda had missed for Zambia.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnyeama dived to his right to stop Nyirenda's penalty after Sikombe Chivhuta and Christopher Katongo and Emmanuel Mayuka had all scored for Zambia.\n\n\n\n\n\nObefemi Martins, Victor Nsofor, Peter Odemwingie, and John Obi Mikel all scored for Nigeria.", 'qa': [{'question': 'what did nigeria become', 'answers': ['fourth team to reach the semifinals']}, {'question': 'WHo booked their place', 'answers': ['Egypt']}, {'question': 'Who does Nigeria play?', 'answers': ['Ghana', 'will now face', 'Egypt']}, {'question': 'Who are the defending champions?', 'answers': ['Egypt']}, {'question': 'what did egypt do', 'answers': ['their place in the African Nations Cup semifinals with a battling 3-1 victory over Cameroon.', 'their place in the African Nations Cup semifinals', 'book']}, {'question': 'how many goals did egypt score', 'answers': ['Two', '3-1']}, {'question': 'What day was the game', 'answers': ['Thursday.']}, {'question': 'What is the competition', 'answers': ['African Nations Cup semifinals', 'the African Nations Cup semifinals']}, {'question': 'Egypt scored how many goals?', 'answers': ['Two']}]}

The company, based in Battle Creek, Michigan, made short order of the already-printed and filled boxes, donating two tons of cereal to the San Francisco Food Bank late last month.\n\n\n\nWith food banks across the country reporting shortages of food, the donation was a welcome one, said the food bank\'s director of development, Christopher Wiley. It took only two weeks for about 3,000 boxes to move through warehouse.\n\n\n\n"Thousands of families benefited from the donation" Wiley said. "It was a surprise to us. We were lacking a lot of cereal. It is a great product many low-income families really need."\n\n\n\n"The real story for us was not the box but what\'s inside the box.

Officials in Washington and Bishkek signed a deal three years ago allowing the United States to renew the arrangement annually through July 2011.\n\n"We do remain in contact with the government of Kyrgyzstan," Yerkin said. "The Manas Air Base continues to operate under existing agreements, as per the coalition\'s efforts in Afghanistan."\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Friday the United States will continue to work with Kyrgyzstan on keeping the base open.

"If we are unable to do that on reasonable terms then, as I have suggested, we are developing alternative methods to get resupply and people into Afghanistan."\n\nThe Manas Air Base outside Bishkek is the only U.S. base in Central Asia and is a major resupply hub for the war in Afghanistan.\n\nIts closing could deal a significant blow to the U.S. military effort there, especially following President Barack Obama\'s announcement of additional troops to halt a resurgence of the country\'s former Taliban rulers.\n\nThe United States pays $17.4 million a year to use Manas, a major logistical and refueling center that supports troops in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said. About 15,000 troops and 500 tons of cargo reportedly move through Manas monthly, it said.\n\nThe air base currently employs more than 1,000 servicemen, 95 percent of whom are Americans, Russia\'s Interfax news agency reported.\n\n"This is an important facility, it has been an important facility, but it\'s not irreplaceable and, if necessary, we will find other options," Whitman said.

{'text': 'Cleveland, Ohio (CNN) -- The niece of the mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, once lived with murder suspect Anthony Sowell, a registered sex offender charged with murder after the remains of 11 victims were found at his home, a spokeswoman for the mayor said Monday.\n\n\n\nLori Frazier, niece of Mayor Frank Jackson, had a relationship with Sowell that ended two years ago, said Andrea Taylor, a spokeswoman for Jackson\'s office. Taylor said it is unclear whether the relationship was romantic.\n\n\n\n"I just want to know why, why he would do this," Frazier told CNN affiliate WOIO on Friday. "He took care of me, good care of me. I never would have thought there were some bodies in the house."\n\n\n\n"I lived with him from 2005 to 2007 and he didn\'t kill me, but he killed all these girls," she said.\n\n\n\nSowell, 50, is facing five counts of aggravated murder, rape, felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with the deaths. All the victims were African-American women. All that remains of one of them is a skull, wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the basement.\n\n\n\nSowell served 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted rape in 1989. He was released in 2005.\n\n\n\nSo far, nine of the 11 victims found at Sowell\'s home have been identified. The latest two were identified Monday by the Cuyahoga County Coroner\'s Office, police said. They are Janice Webb, 49, and Kim Yvette Smith, who was 43 when last seen. Both women were from Cleveland.\n\n\n\nWebb was last seen on June 3 and was reported missing on August 2, police said. Smith was last seen January 1, but was not reported missing until November 2.\n\n\n\nA grand jury on Monday returned an indictment against Sowell in connection with an alleged assault and rape of a 36-year-old woman September 22, Cuyahoga County prosecutors said in a news release. The investigation into that incident was what led police, armed with a search warrant, to Sowell\'s home, where they discovered the bodies late last month.\n\n\n\nThe alleged victim encountered Sowell while walking in the neighborhood, and he took her back to his home, where he became violent and raped her, prosecutors said. "While raping her, he strangled her with a cord until she lost consciousness," the statement said. "When she regained consciousness, he led her out of the house."\n\n\n\nSowell faces a charge of attempted murder in the incident, along with two counts of rape, two counts of kidnapping and two counts of felonious assault, authorities said.\n\n\n\nSowell will be arraigned on the new charges Friday, authorities said.\n\n\n\nThe charges are first-degree felonies except for the assault charges, which are second-degree felonies, prosecutors said. If convicted, he would face a sentence of up to life in prison.\n\n\n\nThe investigation into the homicides continues, prosecutor Bill Mason said in the news release.\n\n\n\n"Upon completion of the investigation, the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor\'s Office working with the Cleveland Police Department will present evidence to the grand jury seeking the death penalty for these heinous murders committed by Sowell."\n\n\n\nResidents of the area near the home said they had noted a smell in the neighborhood, but assumed it was from nearby Ray\'s Sausage Company.\n\n\n\nAsked whether she had noticed a foul odor, Frazier told WOIO, "Yeah, I smelled stuff, but he always told me that -- at first he said it was his stepmother downstairs. And then I guess after she left, he told me that it was Ray\'s Sausage."\n\n\n\nFrazier said Sowell brought other women to the home when she was not there.\n\n\n\n"I love my niece very much and while she has made some decisions that have not been in her best interest, she has my full support," Jackson said in a written statement.\n\n\n\n"As a family, we are extremely fortunate that she was not a victim in this case as she did have a prior relationship with the suspect that ended approximately two years ago. My focus continues to be on making sure the loved ones of the victims get the attention, closure and justice they deserve and it is my hope that everyone remains committed to that goal."\n\n\n\nHundreds of Cleveland residents gathered outside the house Sunday night to remember the victims.\n\n\n\n"It\'s hard, because I want to burn it down," said Inez Fortson, whose daughter Telacia, 31 and a mother of three children, is among the dead.\n\n\n\nSowell has been placed on a suicide watch at the request of his attorney, according to Sowell\'s public defender, Kathleen DeMetz. A psychiatric evaluation has been ordered but it\'s unlikely to happen until after the case goes before a grand jury, the next expected step.\n\n\n\nPolice recovered the first bodies after they went to Sowell\'s home to follow up on a rape accusation.\n\n\n\nIn a separate incident, neighbors on October 20 reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor. Firefighters and paramedics responded, and later notified police. But the woman told officers that she was at the home "partying," when she fell off the roof, and no charges were filed.\n\n\n\nAgents from the FBI\'s Behavioral Science Unit are assisting Cleveland police, Cleveland FBI spokesman Scott Wilson has said. The agents are preparing a profile of Sowell for police, tracing his life and habits, and his DNA will be entered into a national database to see whether it can be linked to any unsolved crimes.\n\n\n\n"Our experts tell us it\'s likely he\'s done this before," said Frank Figliuzzi, special agent in charge of the FBI\'s Cleveland office. "He\'s probably done it elsewhere, and so we need to determine whether or not he\'s responsible for other unsolved murders and rapes around the country."\n\n\n\nIn addition, the FBI is investigating whether Sowell might be linked to crimes abroad, Figliuzzi said.\n\n\n\n"We know, for example, he was a Marine, he was assigned to California, he served in Okinawa, Japan, and we\'ll be matching all the facts from these crimes here in Cleveland with the crimes that remain unsolved in our database, and we\'ll specifically be looking at those locations where he\'s previously lived."\n\n\n\nAllen Sowell, the suspect\'s half-brother, told CNN he last saw his brother more than 20 years ago. Their stepmother, who lived in the house after Anthony Sowell got out of prison, said she knew of nothing odd going on at the time, Allen Sowell said.\n\n\n\nThe stepmother tried to get Anthony Sowell evicted from the house in 2007 because he wasn\'t paying rent, Allen Sowell said. Anthony Sowell said he shouldn\'t have to pay rent on a house that belonged to his father, who died in 2004.  Anthony Sowell remained in the house when his stepmother had to be hospitalized in 2007, his half-brother said.\n\n\n\nAllen Sowell said he was aware of his half-brother\'s prison record, but "just couldn\'t fathom" the accusations now facing him.\n\n\n\n"I didn\'t think he was in that bad of a mental state," Allen Sowell said. "You never think it would happen to your family. It\'s a horrible feeling."\n\n\n\nAt 66, Allen Sowell is 16 years older than his half-brother, and the two didn\'t meet until Anthony Sowell was 9.\n\n\n\nHe added, "He deserves whatever he gets from the justice system."\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Susan Candiotti, Edmund Demarche and Ross Levitt and CNN Radio\'s Brendan Gage contributed to this report.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What did Frank Jackson say?', 'answers': ['"I love my niece very much and while she has made some decisions that have not been in her best interest, she has my full support,"', '"I just want to know why, why he would do this,"', '"He took care of me, good care of me.

{'text': 'NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Authorities are seeking the public\'s assistance in identifying a teenage girl who mysteriously turned up in Manhattan two weeks ago, claiming to have no memory of her family, her home -- or even her own name.\n\n\n\nThe teen has recalled an excerpt from the fantasy novel "Fool\'s Fate" by Robin Hobb.\n\n\n\n"I just want to know who I am," the girl says in a statement released by the New York City Administration for Children\'s Services. The teen, who is being referred to as Jane Doe, continues, "I want to know who I am and what happened to me."\n\n\n\nThe Caucasian young woman, described by New York ACS as "very soft-spoken," is 5 feet, 6 inches tall, light-skinned, with short, straight, cropped blond hair and blue eyes. Doctors are estimating her age to be between 14 and 17.\n\n\n\nACS Commissioner John B. Mattingly appealed to the public in a statement, "asking anyone who may know this young woman to help us locate her family as quickly as possible, so we can safely reunite her with those who love her."\n\n\n\nThe girl was found in midtown Manhattan around 12:30 a.m. October 9 outside the Covenant House youth shelter, although the organization tells CNN that she was not a resident at the time and did not appear as if she intended to seek refuge at the facility.\n\n\n\nAccording to its Web site, with nearly 7,000 youths seeking shelter per year, "Covenant House New York is the nation\'s largest adolescent care agency serving homeless, runaway and at-risk youth."\n\n\n\nA security guard for the shelter noticed the girl walking around on the sidewalk near Covenant House and approached her. Finding her unresponsive, he called the New York City Police Department.\n\n\n\nPolice officers interviewed the young woman, but it became clear that she couldn\'t provide authorities with any information about herself. The NYPD said she was wearing military green camouflage pants, a black shirt and a pair of black sneakers when she was discovered.\n\n\n\nChildren\'s Services said the girl recently wrote down the name "Amber" and has responded to it on one occasion, but she has no idea whether it is her true name.\n\n\n\nOn another occasion she is said to have recalled certain words, which turned out to be an excerpt from the fantasy novel "Fool\'s Fate" by Robin Hobb. The girl is also apparently writing a fantasy story of her own that features a heroine named Rian, "who\'s been raised by the commander of the guard post on the edge of a fantasy kingdom," says the young woman.\n\n\n\nThe girl has a 2- to 4-inch scar on her lower left back and had a black, handwritten birthday message on her arm, addressed to a name of Japanese origin, when she was found, police said Friday.\n\n\n\nJudging from poor dental hygiene, said Lt. Christopher Zimmerman, she appears to have been living on the streets for some time.\n\n\n\n"This case has been going on since October 9," Zimmerman said.

{'text': 'New York (CNN) -- Decades ago, when the Department of Defense was creating the predecessor to today\'s Internet, one of the main goals was to create a communications system that could endure catastrophic disasters.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Internet was designed to have no central point of failure, allowing anyone to run his or her own communications channel. This was a system that could withstand a nuclear attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the days since the Haiti earthquake, the popular social networking and microblogging service has been used for rescue efforts and for fundraising to help stabilize and rebuild the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it was big news when Twitter was offline for 90 minutes  Wednesday morning. Technology pundits promptly began hand-wringing -- the weaknesses of having a single point of failure to critical communications had been revealed again! Could we trust Twitter? Did this mean the Web couldn\'t help us fulfill our most basic obligations to those in need?\n\n\n\n\n\nNot at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\'s no reason that organizations or individuals who want to use the Web to relay critical information have to rely on Twitter or Facebook or Google or any other giant of the technology industry in the first place. We\'ve just forgotten a bit about how the Internet was supposed to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nRescue organizations and charities should simply be able to use the Web sites they already have to deliver those messages.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd wasn\'t that the promise of the Web in the first place? Weren\'t we going to stop relying on individual companies as gatekeepers for communication? When blogs took off a few years ago, wasn\'t it with the promise that we\'d all be able to share our voices without having to ask any company for permission? Why did we give that up?\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe it\'s because they made it look so easy.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter has done an impressive job of growing to handle its enormous number of users, while keeping its service simple. The company has even shown a reassuring sensitivity to the civic and social obligations that come from running such a popular communication service. Companies such as Facebook and Google have stepped up, too. Their hearts appear to be in the right place, and they\'re doing real work to help people communicate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Web is bigger than any one site or any one social network. In my own work, I run a nonprofit that strives to connect government policymakers to the expertise of ordinary people using the Web.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\'ll naturally make great use of Twitter and Facebook and all the other services, but it\'d be unforgivable to pick only one of them as a platform for civic engagement. Telling people the only way to talk to the White House is on Facebook is like saying you can only call your senator by using a particular phone company.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that\'s the key lesson to learn from Twitter being down while people are depending on it for communication: Some needs are too important to put in the hands of any single company. Communicating in real time about emergency information is clearly one of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately there\'s good news. Smart inventors have already made cutting-edge technologies that let any site deliver messages with the same immediacy as Twitter or Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the challenge is reminding all of the social institutions, media organizations and government agencies that they need to use their own communications infrastructure just as much as they participate in services such as Twitter and Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reality is social networks come and go.\n\n\n\n\n\nTen years ago, otherwise-sensible companies were paying millions of dollars to America Online to buy "AOL keywords." These were shortcuts to parts of the AOL service, which dominated U.S. Internet access at the time. In fact, many of us have allowed companies to become intermediaries to all our communications, whether it was AOL 10 years ago or Facebook today.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we don\'t need to ask gateways for permission to publish. We can run our own Web sites, at our own Web addresses and keep control over how we communicate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThink how ludicrous it would seem for someone to decide, say, to offer emergency services as an AOL keyword called "911" instead of having people just dial their phones?\n\n\n\n\n\nThat sounds absurd, but you can see advertisements today that essentially say "Find us on Facebook at facebook.com/AcmeWidgets!"\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, Facebook probably won\'t fade away entirely, like early networks such as Friendster. But those Facebook addresses are just like AOL keywords 10 years earlier. And it is conceivable that the organizations and companies who communicate on Facebook today may want to become more independent.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether due to emergency or just the everyday requirements of doing business, they ultimately will stop depending on a single point of contact for their communications.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is, after all, how the Web was designed to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe already see governments and civic organizations using the Web as effectively as the best corporations and media. In the United States, we have a White House that\'s got an iPhone application and a State Department that\'s asking us to define democracy by responding on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\nJudging by how much technology has affected society already, those first experiments will soon evolve into full-fledged platforms for citizen participation and charitable action. And let\'s hope they won\'t have to worry if any one Web site goes down. Because we\'ll have a web of independent but connected communications systems, just as the Internet was always designed to be.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anil Dash.', 'qa': [{'question': 'who is anil dash', 'answers': ['opinions expressed in this commentary', 'The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of']}, {'question': 'What did Anil Dash say the internet was designed for?', 'answers': ['to have no central point of failure,', 'to be.']}, {'question': 'What does Dash remind us about social networks?', 'answers': ["We've just forgotten a bit", 'how the Internet was supposed to work.']}]}
{'text': '(CNN) -- A former government contract employee was indicted on charges of stealing restricted nuclear energy-related materials and putting the United States at risk, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.\n\nSources say the classified materials were taken from the East Tennessee Technology Park.\n\nRoy Lynn Oakley, 67, of Roane County, Tennessee, appeared in federal court in Knoxville on Thursday.\n\nOakley was briefly detained for questioning in the case in January, when authorities first learned of the alleged plot to divulge the materials, government sources told CNN. He voluntarily surrendered Thursday at an FBI field office in Knoxville, the sources said.\n\nOakley is a former employee of Bechtel Jacobs, the Department of Energy\'s prime environmental management contractor at the East Tennessee Technology Park, prosecutors said.\n\nThe indictment states that Oakley, "having possession of, access to and having been entrusted with sections of \'barriers\' and associated hardware used for uranium enrichment through the process of gaseous diffusion ... having reason to believe that such data would be utilized to injure the United States and secure an advantage to a foreign nation, did communicate, transmit and disclose such data to another person."\n\nThe transfer took place January 26, the indictment alleges. Oakley is also charged with converting the material and "restricted data" to his own use. He began doing so on about October 17, 2006, and continued through January, prosecutors said.\n\nProsecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them.\n\nOakley\'s attorney, Herb Moncier, said outside court Thursday that Oakley\'s job was to break rods "into little pieces" and throw them away. Moncier said Oakley had a security clearance, but Moncier did not believe it was a high-level clearance.\n\nThe government alleges that in January, Oakley attempted to sell the "pieces of scrap" to someone he thought was a French agent -- but in reality was an undercover FBI agent, Moncier said. He said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an "appliance" under the law.\n\n"Mr. Oakley has cooperated fully for the last six months," said Moncier, who added that he had traveled to Washington for work on the case.\n\nEach count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\n"While none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization, the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands," Kenneth Wainstein, assistant attorney general for national security, said in the Justice Department statement.\n\nOne government source said the materials involved are not the "crown jewels," but they should not have been taken from the facility.\n\nA "barrier" is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process, according to nuclear energy officials, but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job.\n\nSources told CNN that federal authorities have been following Oakley and investigating the case for at least six months, after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material.\n\nOakley, described as a low-level employee, apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind, an official familiar with the case said.\n\nA government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of Oakley\'s alleged intentions six months ago, the FBI and Department of Energy launched a joint investigation.\n\nThe FBI then developed a sting operation, government officials familiar with the case said, and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country.\n\nEast Tennessee Technology Park is an area of the DOE\'s Oak Ridge reservation "where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985," Gerald Boyd, manager of the DOE\'s Oak Ridge site office, said Thursday. "When they were in use, now over 20 years ago, some of the buildings at ETTP housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium."\n\nBoyd said the technology park and the reservation "are protected by multiple layers of security systems and detection programs, both visible and unseen, meant to identify rogue employees attempting to abuse their access and position."\n\nIn this case, a review of security procedures showed that the system worked and "successfully identified the individual in question," he said.

{'text': 'LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Fans wishing to attend singer Michael Jackson\'s memorial service next week will have to register for the 11,000 free tickets, organizers said Thursday.\n\n\n\nMichael Jackson is shown rehearsing at the Staples Center on June 23, two days before his death.\n\n\n\nDetails on how to register for the 10 a.m. (1 p.m. ET) service at the 20,000-seat Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, Tuesday are to be announced Friday.\n\n\n\nJackson\'s family will hold a private ceremony before the public memorial service, his brother said Thursday.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to CNN\'s Larry King, Jermaine Jackson said the ceremony will be held Tuesday morning, but he did not say where.\n\n\n\nJackson rehearsed at Staples Center two nights before he died, and he appeared healthy in a video clip of the rehearsal obtained by CNN. Jackson died June 25 after collapsing at his rented home in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nAEG, promoter of Jackson\'s planned London, England, shows, released the short video of Jackson rehearsing in the arena on June 23.\n\n\n\nJackson sang "They Don\'t Care About Us," a song from his "HIStory" album, as he danced along with eight male dancers.  Watch Jackson rehearse »\n\n\n\nJackson did not specify where he wished to be buried in a 2002 will, which was filed in court Wednesday.  Watch CNN\'s Anderson Cooper talk about his interview with AEG »\n\n\n\nMore information emerged Thursday about how Jackson\'s estate will be shared, which his will estimated in 2002 as being worth $500 million.\n\n\n\nThe family trust created by Jackson to receive all of his assets includes his mother, his children and a list of charities, according to a person with direct knowledge of the contents of the trust.\n\n\n\nMother Katherine Jackson\'s 40 percent share would go to Michael Jackson\'s three children after her death, the source said.\n\n\n\nThe children -- ages 7, 11 and 12 -- also will share 40 percent of the estate\'s assets, and the remaining 20 percent will benefit charities designated by the executors of the will, the source said.\n\n\n\nA judge has delayed for a week, until July 13, a hearing to decide whether Katherine Jackson will remain the temporary guardian of Jackson\'s children.\n\n\n\nAt a brief talk with reporters Thursday, an attorney for Jackson\'s ex-wife Debbie Rowe said she "has not reached a final decision" on whether she will challenge Jackson\'s mother for custody of Jackson\'s two oldest children, according to her lawyer.\n\n\n\nA Los Angeles TV station quoted Rowe on Thursday morning saying, "I want my children."\n\n\n\nExcept for the statement to the radio station, she has not publicly indicated whether she would seek custody now that Jackson is dead.\n\n\n\nRowe was left out of the will.\n\n\n\n"I have intentionally omitted to provide for my former wife, Deborah Rowe Jackson," the will said.\n\n\n\nThe will nominated Katherine Jackson, now 79, as the guardian of his children. If Katherine Jackson were to die, "I nominate Diana Ross as guardian," Jackson said in the will, written July 7, 2002.\n\n\n\nSinger Ross, 65, was a lifelong friend of Jackson\'s.  Watch how the two had a close relationship »\n\n\n\nThere\'s also a question on when the will\'s executors should take over control of the late entertainer\'s assets, which Judge Mitchell Beckloff temporarily placed under Katherine Jackson\'s control.\n\n\n\nOne man named as executor is John Branca, who represented Jackson from 1980 until 2006 and was hired again before the singer\'s death. He helped acquire Jackson\'s music catalog, which is worth millions.\n\n\n\nThe other is music industry executive John McClain, a longtime Jackson friend who has worked with him and his sister Janet.\n\n\n\nDEA reportedly joins investigation\n\n\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration has joined the investigation into Jackson\'s death, a federal law enforcement official said Wednesday night.\n\n\n\nAnd the California State Attorney General\'s office said Thursday that it is helping the Los Angeles Police Department in its investigation. The attorney general\'s office said it will assist police in sifting through information in a state database that monitors controlled medication.\n\n\n\nTwo law enforcement officials separately confirmed the DEA inquiry, saying agents would look at doctors involved with Jackson, their practices and their possible sources of medicine supply.\n\n\n\nNeither official wanted to be identified because they could not comment publicly on the matter.\n\n\n\nOfficially, a DEA spokeswoman referred questions to the Los Angeles Police Department, which would not confirm the involvement.\n\n\n\n"We routinely offer assistance to any agency regarding the Federal Controlled Substance Act," said Sarah Pullen of the DEA. "However, at this time, we have nothing further to comment about the death of Michael Jackson."\n\n\n\nSpeculation about the role of drugs has been swirling since Jackson died June 25 at his rented estate in Holmby Hills. The cause of his death, at age 50, was pending toxicology results.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, police released a car belonging to Jackson\'s cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray. They had impounded the vehicle Friday, saying it might contain evidence -- possibly prescription medications.\n\n\n\nPolice did not say whether they found anything.\n\n\n\nMurray\'s attorneys issued a statement, asking the public to reserve judgment about the cause of death until the coroner\'s tests are complete.\n\n\n\n"Based on our agreement with Los Angeles investigators, we are waiting on real information to come from viable sources like the Los Angeles medical examiner\'s office about the death of Michael Jackson," the statement said. "We will not be responding to rumors and innuendo."\n\n\n\nNo public showing planned for Neverland\n\n\n\nLogistical and financial challenges derailed earlier plans for a public viewing and private memorial at Neverland Ranch.\n\n\n\nPlanning had been under way for a motorcade to carry Jackson\'s body from Los Angeles to the Santa Barbara County ranch, which state and local officials suggested would be difficult and costly.\n\n\n\nLaw enforcement sources had said a public viewing at the ranch was under consideration for Friday, but a spokesman for the family said that it would not happen.\n\n\n\n"Plans are under way regarding a public memorial for Michael Jackson, and we will announce those plans shortly," said Ken Sunshine, whose public relations firm had been hired by the Jackson family.\n\n\n\nDespite the announcement, more than two dozen TV satellite trucks lined the narrow two-lane road leading to the ranch.\n\n\n\nFor a time, the California Highway Patrol closed the road to clear up a small bottleneck of cars created by Jackson fans and the media.\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Drew Griffin, Kathleen Johnston, Michael Carey, Paul Vercammen, Carol Cratty and Kara Finnstrom contributed to this report.', 'qa': [{'question': "Who has  joined inquiry into Jackson's death?", 'answers': ['family', 'The Drug Enforcement Administration']}, {'question': 'Where will the memorial take place?', 'answers': ['at Neverland Ranch.', 'Staples Center in Los Angeles, California,', 'Neverland Ranch.', 'the']}, {'question': "How many days before Jackson's death was the video taken?", 'answers': ['his', 'two nights', 'he died,', 'two']}, {'question': "Where will Jackon's memorial be?", 'answers': ['Los Angeles, California,', 'Staples Center', 'Staples Center in Los Angeles,']}, {'question': "Who joins the inquiry into Jackson's death?", 'answers': ['look at doctors involved with', 'The Drug Enforcement Administration']}, {'question': 'How many service tickets will be made available?', 'answers': ['20,000-seat', '11,000']}, {'question': 'How many memorial service tickets will be made available?', 'answers': ['11,000']}, {'question': 'Whose memorial will be Tuesday?', 'answers': ["Michael Jackson's"]}]}

{'text': '(CNN) -- Henry Joseph Madden was a good student and track team member in high school, but he had a secret: He sometimes wore his mother\'s pantyhose and underwear under his clothes.\n\n\n\nDr. Jennifer Madden, a family physician, began her transition to being female at age 48.\n\n\n\n"I really wanted to be a girl so bad, and that was one way for me to satisfy those feelings," Madden said. "I always felt like someone was looking over my shoulder."\n\n\n\nThe desire to be female never went away. At age 48, Madden confessed these feelings to a doctor, and started seeing a gender therapist who suggested Madden was transgendered.\n\n\n\nThrough reconstructive surgeries, electrolysis, laser procedures and voice lessons, Henry Joseph became Jennifer Elizabeth, known as Jenny. She is a practicing family physician in Nashua, New Hampshire.  Watch Jenny\'s story »\n\n\n\nChastity Bono, child of performer Cher and the late entertainer and politician Sonny Bono, announced Thursday the beginning of a transition from female to a male.\n\n\n\nWhile still relatively rare -- one advocate estimates that 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the American population is transgendered -- the idea of changing gender identity has become more widespread in recent years. The term "LGBT" (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) is more commonly recognized, and transgendered people have been portrayed in the 1999 film "Boys Don\'t Cry" as well as the 2002 book "Middlesex" by Jeffrey Eugenides.\n\n\n\nMany people who have transitioned, including Madden, say they knew they had been born into the wrong gender from childhood. As early as age 3, Dr. Julie Praus, born male, didn\'t understand why her father wanted to play catch. As a boy, Praus learned how to fish and hunt, but enjoyed collecting Depression-era glassware vases. Praus, 48, a psychiatrist in Brattleboro, Vermont, started living as a woman in March 2008.\n\n\n\n"I get up every morning and say, \'Wow, I can actually look at myself in the mirror,\' because I\'ve never been able to do that in my life, because what would stare back at me was not me," Praus said. iReport.com: Share your story of gender change\n\n\n\nDoctors speculate that there is a biological foundation to gender identity, but no one has determined what in the biological makeup determines that gender. The interactions between personality and culture also contribute to identity, said Chris Kraft, clinical director at the Johns Hopkins Sexual Behaviors Consultation Unit.\n\n\n\nThe process of changing genders\n\n\n\nFor people who want a gender change on a biological level, the first step is therapy, experts say. Dr. Gary Alter, a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, California, said patients don\'t come to him until they\'ve been in therapy, a process that can take as much as a year.\n\n\n\nA therapist then gives a physician approval to start the patient on hormone treatment. At that point, the patient may or may not start living as the chosen sex, Alter said.\n\n\n\nFemales seeking to transition into males may elect to have their breasts removed via surgery. With testosterone, they will grow hair on their face and chest after about two years. Read one man\'s female-to-male advice to Chaz Bono\n\n\n\nA higher percentage of males transitioning to females will go forward with genital surgery than females going to males, Alter said. Surgical methods for creating a penis -- which range from making one out of the clitoris to using the skin from the forearms -- are "not perfect," and many patients are happy with just chest surgery, he said.\n\n\n\nGenital surgeries for creating female genitalia are better, he said. Alter\'s method is to make a clitoris out of the head of the penis, and make space for a vagina.\n\n\n\nFacing the rest of the world\n\n\n\nIt is rare for people to undergo a gender transition and then want to reverse it, especially when surgery is involved, experts say.\n\n\n\nSome say changing genders is one of the best things they\'ve done, like Jamison Green, 60, author of "Becoming a Visible Man," who went through chest reconstruction and genital surgery.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t have too hard of a time telling people about it," Green said. "I worried about that a lot in the beginning, before there was any kind of community and support about this condition, but one of the things I learned early on was that living in fear and shame is not very healthy."\n\n\n\nGreen, who started his transition at age 40, is now happily married to a woman whom he did not know before his change. Praus is also married to a woman, who knew her before her transition. Madden has a boyfriend.\n\n\n\n"For the longest time, I really felt like I had a mental illness, and I don\'t feel that way anymore," Madden said.\n\n\n\nBut all three have experienced shock and dismay from others around them. Green said his mother took five years to adjust. One of Praus\' sons doesn\'t speak to her. Madden\'s marriage to a woman ended in divorce during her transition, and her children have struggled.\n\n\n\nYet these three transgendered individuals say they feel better in many ways in their chosen gender roles.\n\n\n\n"My patients say I\'m a better doctor," Praus said. "Some of it is that I\'m not exerting so much energy hiding myself."\n\n\n\nPsychologists recommend that people who change genders adopt a "transgendered identity," and not keep their history of transition a secret. But some who "pass" as their new genders don\'t want to risk stigma, and tell only people closest to them, Kraft said.\n\n\n\nOften, males who transition to females face more problems than females who become males, Kraft said. Transgendered individuals who start as men tend to face more stigma, particularly if they are more noticeably transgendered.\n\n\n\nTransgendered individuals do face some legal quandaries. Some states require people to show proof of a medical procedure before changing gender on documents such as driver\'s licenses, while others require that the person has taken hormones, Kraft said. People may also elect to change their birth certificates to reflect chosen gender.\n\n\n\nChastity Bono, who now goes by "Chaz," has been a prominent gay-rights activist.\n\n\n\n"You could speculate that that could make it more complicated -- when you\'re a public figure -- to take on something stigmatizing" such as a gender transition, Kraft said.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What do doctors speculate?', 'answers': ['that there is a biological foundation to gender identity, but no one has determined', 'in the biological makeup determines that gender.', 'that there is a biological foundation to gender identity,']}, {'question': 'What do people rarely undergo?', 'answers': ['a gender transition and then want to reverse it,', 'rare for', 'to', 'a gender transition and then want to reverse it, especially when surgery is involved,']}, {'question': 'What is the estimated percentage of transgendered Americans?', 'answers': ['0.25 to 0.5 percent of the', 'population is', '0.25 to 0.5 percent']}, {'question': 'What is the percentage of transgender Americans?', 'answers': ['0.25 to 0.5 percent']}, {'question': 'What types of people would want to reverse a gender-reassignment surgery?', 'answers': ['Transgendered individuals']}, {'question': 'What do doctors speculate as the reason for gender identity?', 'answers': ['biological foundation to', 'there is a biological foundation to']}, {'question': 'What surgery do people undergo and then rarely want to reverse?', 'answers': ['gender transition']}, {'question': 'What proportion of the American population is transgendered?', 'answers': ['estimates that 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the', 'one advocate estimates that 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the', 'is', '0.25 to 0.5 percent']}, {'question': 'Biological foundation is an influence to what?', 'answers': ['gender identity,']}]}

{'text': 'LONDON, England (CNN) -- Scientists in the United States are developing a "synthetic tree" capable of collecting carbon around 1,000 times faster than the real thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nA conceptual design of how the "synthetic tree" might look should they ever reach the stage of production.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the wind blows though plastic "leaves," the carbon is trapped in a chamber, compressed and stored as liquid carbon dioxide.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technology is similar to that used to capture carbon from flue stacks at coal-fired power plants, but the difference is that the "synthetic tree" can catch carbon anytime, anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Half of your emissions come from small, distributed sources where collection at the site is either impossible or impractical," said Professor Klaus Lackner, Ewing-Worzel Professor of Geophysics in the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia University.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We aim for applications like gasoline in cars or jet fuel in airplanes. We are going after CO2 that otherwise is nearly impossible to collect," he told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the idea of carbon-catchers may sound far-fetched, an early model has been built and Lackner is in the process of writing a proposal for consideration by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe personally explained the concept in a 45-minute meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu last month at a three-day symposium on climate change in London.\n\n\n\n\n\n"He was there and I was there and he showed interest," Lackner told CNN. "That\'s exciting, but I don\'t particularly want to discuss this in a public forum because I think this gives me a little bit of an opportunity to tailor my proposals to the Department of Energy in a way that makes them more palatable."\n\n\n\n\n\nLackner started working on the concept of an ambient carbon catcher in 1998. "I argued back then and I still argue that the reason this can be done, from a theoretical point of view, is that the CO2 in the air is actually surprisingly concentrated, therefore the device you need to collect CO2 is quite small."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe "synthetic tree" looks more like a public convenience block than a hi-tech method of reducing carbon emissions, but Lackner told CNN it is highly efficient for its size when compared, for example, to a modern power-generating wind turbine.\n\n\n\n\n\n"If you give me one of those big windmills which have those big areas through which the rotor moves -- how much CO2 can I avoid? And if I had an equally sized CO2 collector -- how much CO2 can I collect? It turns out the collector is several hundred times better than the windmill."\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the "synthetic tree" an interesting alternative, or a  scientific flight of fancy that\'s unlikely to happen? Sound Off below.\n\n\n\n\n\nLackner told CNN that initial concerns over the cost of the technology were focused on the "front-end" carbon collector, including the sorbent used to catch the carbon dioxide in the air.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut after years of research, Lackner told CNN he and his colleagues have developed a sorbent that is "close to the ideal," in that it uses a relatively small amount of energy to release the CO2 and is not prohibitively expensive.\n\n\n\n\n\n"By the time we make liquid CO2 we have spent approximately 50 kilojoules [of electricity] per mole of CO2." Compare that, Lackner said, to the average power plant in the U.S. which produces one mole of CO2 with every 230 kilojoules of electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\n"In other words, if we simply plugged our device in to the power grid to satisfy its energy needs, for every roughly 1000 kilograms [of carbon dioxide] we collected we would re-emit 200, so 800 we can chalk up as having been successful," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLackner told CNN the biggest cost was at the "back-end" of the collector, primarily the technology used to release the CO2 from the sorbent.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said for that reason, on a cost-basis, the "synthetic tree" could not compete with modern coal-fired power plants that are designed to release fewer carbon emissions than their older predecessors. But he said when compared to the cost of retro-fitting an existing coal plant, the "synthetic tree" becomes more viable.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The bottom line is we have in this way the ability to deal with the problem at a cost which is somewhat higher than on a coal-fired power plant retro-fit, but not much higher."\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides, he said, the technology is not being developed as an alternative to the carbon capture and storage methods currently being tested for large-scale use on coal-fired power stations. He\'s targeting carbon that\'s already in the air.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of the "synethic tree" has caught the imagination of one of the first scientists to warn the world about global warming, Lackner\'s colleague at Columbia University, Newberry Professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Professor Wally Broecker.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I\'m extremely excited about this. I think this is something that the world\'s going to have to have, unfortunately," Broecker told CNN from Madrid where he received a BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award for his work on the issue of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nBroecker told CNN most people still don\'t recognize the magnitude of the task the world faces in reducing global carbon emissions, and it was likely that one day urgent action would need to be taken, above and beyond the current measures being discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We\'re probably not going to stop CO2 rising until it\'s double what it was near-1800 and maybe even more than that," he said. "I think we will find that the planet is too warm, ice is melting too fast... and we\'ll want to bring the CO2 back down again. The only way we can do that on a short timescale would be to pull it back out of the atmosphere."\n\n\n\n\n\nBroecker told CNN the units could stand in the middle of Australia, for example, and their presence wouldn\'t significantly disrupt the atmospheric distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Each unit would take out a ton of CO2 a day -- which would be the amount of CO2 produced by 20 average automobiles in the U.S.A.

{'text': 'COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lankan soldiers have seized a key rebel stronghold after launching a surprise attack early Sunday morning, the head of Sri Lanka\'s army announced.\n\nSri Lankan army chief Sarath Fonseka says a key Tamil town has been taken in a national TV broadcast Sunday.\n\nTroops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency.\n\n"Our troops fought their way through a 40 km (25 mile) thick jungle track," Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said in a televised address on Sunday.\n\n"This is the long awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years," the Sri Lanka Army chief said.\n\nThere is no confirmation from the rebels that the strategic garrison has been overtaken.\n\nThe Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country\'s ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead.\n\nThe rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government.\n\nIn recent days, the military has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds.\n\nEarlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula.\n\nIt had been in rebel hands for more than nine years.\n\nThe re-capture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea.\n\n"The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally," Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN. "They lost... about 90 percent of what they had."\n\nDespite major government gains, critics point to ongoing civilian casualties resultant from the conflict.\n\n"This is an important strategic success for the army, but literally tens of thousands of people, children, are in the line of fire," United Nations spokesman James Elder said in a phone conversation Sunday.\n\n"Some Sri Lankan U.N. staff are trapped there," he added. "Convoys are going to the area, delivering emergency supplies, but these are not sufficient for the number of people in need."\n\nSri Lankan authorities are barring journalists and humanitarian aid workers from areas where heavy fighting is taking place.\n\nAmnesty International spokesman Shuransu Mishra estimated that "over a quarter of a million of the population, mostly Tamils, are trapped between the two sides."\n\nThe organization says greater access and protection for aid workers and journalists are needed as news agencies struggle to report an accurate picture of the conflict.\n\n"The Sri Lankan authorities are doing little to ensure the safety of the country\'s media, or to prosecute those responsible for murdering or attacking them," Amnesty International spokeswoman Yolanda Foster said in a written statement on Friday.\n\n"They (Sri Lankan authorities) are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation," she said.\n\nAt least 14 journalists have been killed since the start of 2006, according to the statement.\n\nOthers have been driven from the country by death threats, or in fear of detention and torture by government authorities, it said.', 'qa': [{'question': 'When did rebels gain control?', 'answers': ['early Sunday morning,', '1996']}, {'question': 'Who wants independent homeland?', 'answers': ['Tamil Tigers', 'have fought for an', 'The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)', "for the country's ethnic Tamil", 'the Tamil Tigers', 'minority since 1983.']}, {'question': 'Who is making progress?', 'answers': ['the military', 'military']}, {'question': 'What did rebels gain control over?', 'answers': ['Mullaittivu in 1996 and established', 'military garrison there, according', 'Mullaittivu', 'the government.']}, {'question': 'When did they do this?', 'answers': ['early Sunday morning,']}, {'question': 'Who wants an independent homeland?', 'answers': ['Sarath Fonseka', 'Sri Lankan soldiers', 'Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam']}, {'question': 'Which northern town did troops regain control of?', 'answers': ['Elephant Pass,', 'Mullaittivu']}, {'question': 'What did they establish there?', 'answers': ['military garrison']}, {'question': 'Who gained control?', 'answers': ['Earlier this month, troops regained', 'Sri Lankan soldiers', 'The rebels', 'rebels']}]}
{'text': '(CNN) -- Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and members of the Sex Pistols have led tributes to the band\'s former manager Malcolm McLaren who died of cancer on Thursday aged 64.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs manager of the Sex Pistols and owner, with his then-lover Westwood, of the Sex boutique in London during the mid-1970s, McLaren was considered one of the pioneers of the punk movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n"When we were young and I fell in love with Malcolm, I thought he was beautiful and I still do," Vivienne Westwood said in a written statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nWestwood\'s son with McLaren, Joe Corre, her other son, Ben Westwood, and McLaren\'s girlfriend, Young Kim, were with him when he died in Switzerland after a battle with mesothelioma.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I thought he is a very charismatic, special and talented person. The thought of him dead is really something very sad," said Westwood.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lead singer of the Sex Pistols, John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten, also paid tribute to the band\'s former manager.\n\n\n\n\n\n"For me, Malc was always entertaining, and I hope you remember that," Lydon said. "Above all else, he was an entertainer, and I will miss him, and so should you."\n\n\n\n\n\nMcLaren and the Sex Pistols had a turbulent relationship during the band\'s brief, spectacular and controversial career.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally known as the Strand, McLaren drafted in Lydon as lead singer and renamed the band the Sex Pistols.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A thin girl with caramel skin and a yellow silk blouse walks alone through a barren landscape of rubble.\n\n\n\nNway prepares for her new job, selling vegetables from her aunt\'s garden.\n\n\n\nHer legs are marked by cuts. Her face is smeared with white streaks of powder. And her eyes are blank as she sifts through the debris of what used to be her home before Cyclone Nargis slammed into Myanmar one night and swept her parents away.\n\n\n\nHer name is Nway, and that\'s how she looked when aid workers found her after Nargis destroyed her isolated village. She refused to talk about the cyclone, pretending it never took place. She became, according to a CNN story, the "girl who refuses to remember."\n\n\n\nA year later, an aid worker returned to the village to see how Nway was doing. She found Nway living in a tidy, bamboo house flanked by palm trees. The 8-year-old greeted her visitor with a big smile. Then she asked whether she could play with her visitor\'s hair.\n\n\n\nPam Sitko, the aid worker, said Nway -- like thousands of people in Myanmar -- is slowly recovering one year after Nargis demolished their country.\n\n\n\n"After all of her pain and loss, she really is a spunky girl," said Sitko, who works with World Vision International, a humanitarian group. "She wasn\'t shy about reaching out to touch my blonde hair."\n\n\n\nThe night everything changed\n\n\n\nNway\'s resilience is shared by many in Myanmar, aid workers say.\n\n\n\nLast year\'s cyclone was catastrophic. It killed at least 140,000 people and left at least 2 million people without homes, according to the United Nations World Food Programme.\n\n\n\nThe brunt of the storm hit Myanmar\'s delta region, the country\'s bread basket. It wiped out crops, shrimp farms and fish ponds. A year later, many fields remain unplanted; supplies are short, and the lack of drinking water complicates recovery efforts, World Food Programme officials say.\n\n\n\nYet some sense of normal life is returning, said Mia Marina, a program support manager for World Vision\'s Nargis response efforts. World Vision is building cyclone-resistant schools and providing supplies to cyclone survivors.\n\n\n\n"Most of the people are going back to their livelihoods," Marina said. "Kids are going to school. The markets are open."\n\n\n\nThe people of Myanmar are also buying planting tools and seed in preparation for the monsoon rains that typically come in May, Sitko said.\n\n\n\n"Everyone is hoping that this is the moment that it turns around," Sitko said. "It\'s an exciting time, a time of hope."\n\n\n\nThat hope appears to have spread to Nway.\n\n\n\nShe is fortunate to be alive. The cyclone killed her mother and father. The winds were so powerful that they blew away the village buffalo. In Nway\'s village, 120 people out of a population of 430 people lost their lives.\n\n\n\nNway survived because she was staying with her aunt. The pair joined a group squeezed in to the village headman\'s house to survive, Sitko said.\n\n\n\nNway wouldn\'t talk about the cyclone after aid workers found her a month later. She would walk away whenever she was asked about that night. Now, according to Sitko, who wrote about her meeting for World Vision, Nway can talk a little about her loss.\n\n\n\nSitko said Nway shared one memory from the morning after the cyclone while sitting in her aunt\'s house:\n\n\n\n"When I walked to my aunt\'s house that day, my legs were scratched, and I passed lots of dead bodies," Nway said. "I wanted to help, because everyone was working, but I was too scared, so I only helped clean up my auntie\'s yard."\n\n\n\nNway dreams of her future\n\n\n\nNway prefers to talk about other subjects. One is her new job. She helps her aunt sell vegetables from their garden. On most mornings, she smears white powder made from tree bark on her cheeks (it\'s used as a skin beautifier by women and children in Myanmar). Then she balances a tray of vegetables on her head and walks to a village road to call out to potential customers.\n\n\n\nNway told Sitko that she\'s made "four new best friends." They like to memorize new words and play hide and seek after school.\n\n\n\n"I\'m always the fastest runner," she told Sitko.\n\n\n\nNway is starting to become aware of life outside her village.\n\n\n\n"She was very proud," Sitko said. "She explained that she had recently taken a trip to another village with her aunties, and she wasn\'t afraid."\n\n\n\nNway doesn\'t know, though, where she would attend school as she gets older, Sitko said. She\'ll have to pay to attend school away from her village one day, but her aunt and uncle can\'t afford the costs.\n\n\n\n"She wanted to study and said that she was smart," Sitko said. "She said she would be willing to travel to a school outside of her village if she had to."\n\n\n\nNway has already taken a more difficult journey.\n\n\n\nThe shocked girl who aid workers met a year ago has changed, Sitko said. Now Nway can remember -- and smile again.\n\n\n\n"I was expecting a very different girl," Sitko said. "The little girl I met was very confident.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Insurgents locked in a standoff with U.S. Marines tricked them by dressing up as women to escape, a task force spokesman said Monday.\n\n\n\nU.S. Marines scan the site of a blast that hit a U.S. vehicle in southern Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nWomen and children had been caught in the standoff between the armed groups, but some of the women were not what they seemed, according to task force spokesman Capt. William Pelletier.\n\n\n\nAfter the Marines began taking fire from insurgents in the town of Khan Neshin, in south Afghanistan near the Helmand River, the militants ran into a multiple-room compound, the U.S. military said.\n\n\n\nUnsure of whether civilians were inside the compound, the Marines had an interpreter talk to the insurgents, said an official who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly. After some time, a number of women and children left the compound, the military official said.\n\n\n\nThe released hostages told the Marines that there were no more civilians inside the compound, Pelletier said. But the Marines held their fire anyway, the official said. About 4 p.m. (7:30 a.m. ET), in the midst of the standoff, another group of women and children emerged from the compound, the official said. The Marines continued to hold their fire and wait out the insurgents, the official said.\n\n\n\nFinally, a screaming woman emerged from the compound with a bullet wound to her hand, Pelletier said. Then, another group of women came out, covered from head to toe according to custom, he said, with a couple of children in tow. The Marines attended to the wounded woman while the others walked away.\n\n\n\nWhen the Marines went into the compound, they discovered that it empty, Pelletier said.

The government takeover of Khan Neshin marks the first time coalition forces have had a sustained presence so far south in the Helmand River valley, the release said.\n\n\n\nThe mission to secure Khan Neshin coincides with "establishing secure conditions" for August elections in Afghanistan, according to the release.\n\n\n\nElsewhere in Afghanistan, a six U.S. soldiers were killed Monday by two roadside bombs, a representative for NATO forces said. Four were killed in Kunduz province in northern Afghanistan, the U.S. military said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Verizon has been touted as having the biggest, baddest, fastest 4G around. It\'s been this way since the carrier debuted its LTE network in late 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut now that AT&T has joined the LTE game, consumers looking for top speeds might consider turning their focus to AT&T instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf only for a while.\n\n\n\n\n\nMetrico Wireless, a firm that does network and mobile device analytics, took a look at 4G LTE service in the U.S., focusing on two of the nation\'s largest carriers, Verizon and AT&T.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company\'s latest report shows that AT&T\'s average LTE speeds are better than Verizon\'s (for now at least), and that LTE provides more than five times the performance of the carriers\' respective 3G offerings.\n\n\n\n\n\nMetrico used five 4G LTE handsets for its tests: two on AT&T, three on Verizon. On AT&T, the HTC Vivid and Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket were measured. The HTC Thunderbolt, Samsung Droid Charge and Motorola Droid Bionic were tested on Verizon\'s network.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn stationary download speeds, AT&T\'s 4G LTE handsets outperformed those on Verizon, but Metrico believes this disparity is likely due to the fact that Verizon\'s LTE service is more established and has significantly more subscribers using data on it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, as of April, Verizon had over half a million LTE subscribers. AT&T, meanwhile, just launched its LTE network in five markets this summer.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while AT&T\'s data speeds were better, web pages actually loaded faster on the three Verizon smartphones tested. "In general, the subscriber experience is not simply driven by the network or the device, but by the combination of the two," the report states.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Even devices with similar specifications connected to similar network technologies still demonstrate variation in performance."\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was especially true with regards to video performance. Of the smartphones tested, the Samsung Droid Charge (on Verizon) consistently yielded the highest frame delivery rate, while the Motorola Droid Bionic (also on Verizon) had the lowest.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, if you\'re really concerned about web page load times, consider this: All carrier-to-carrier comparisons notwithstanding, both AT&T and Verizon handsets delivered web page load times that were 80 to 85 percent shorter on LTE relative to 3G.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about battery life on an LTE device, notoriously reported as being poor? Well, depending on how you use your device, you may be able to squeeze out a few more hours, as the report found that battery life was heavily related to app use.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the AT&T Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket, you\'re going to get 300 to 350 minutes of use out of your device, whether you\'re a power user or someone who\'s making calls all day long.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the Verizon Droid Bionic, though, those who primarily use their phones for voice calling will gain about 150 minutes of usage over those who spend most of their time on Twitter and Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nVerizon\'s LTE network is currently the largest in terms of nationwide coverage, but AT&T\'s is set to rival it as it expands.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, indeed, we\'re finally beginning to see LTE infrastructure build-outs, industry-wide. Joining Metro PCS, Verizon and AT&T in the LTE game is Cricket Wireless, perhaps best known for its budget mobile phone and prepaid plan options.\n\n\n\n\n\nCricket will offer speeds up to 6 Mbps with a 5 GB data cap.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Coming back this weekend after a stay in Europe, I had that distinct sensation -- last felt when Lehman Brothers capsized, setting off the Great Recession -- that we once again find ourselves at the mercy of events and people just beyond our control.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere at home, one hears that by Wednesday dawn, we will know whether BP\'s latest big try to stop the oil spill will work. If it does, we can begin to feel that we are moving in the right direction, but if it doesn\'t -- well, no one is quite sure what Plan D looks like. Is this really where we have come: that the fate of our precious coastlines and the waters off our coasts are in the hands of a single foreign-based company?\n\n\n\n\n\nA month ago, it looked like the White House was on top of this problem, as Cabinet officers scurried here and there, the Coast Guard and others swung into action, there were talks with BP, and the president paid a personal visit. But increasingly, it has become apparent that the federal government may be present but is not in charge.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt keeps saying that BP bears ultimate responsibility. It is keeping the press away. No wonder James Carville, Chris Matthews and Donna Brazile exploded late last week. They are right on a basic point: Ultimately it is not the responsibility of BP or any other company to protect American interests but the responsibility of the federal government. Some Obama supporters have argued that the 1990 Oil Pollution Act limits the president\'s capacity to take action. Others disagree. Either way, in an emergency, laws can be changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough this disaster is not an existential threat, it could be argued that if the U.S. government had fought World War II in the same way it has fought the oil spill, we might well be speaking German now. Faced with a growing danger to our well-being, a WWII-type government would at minimum have:\n\n\n\n\n\n• Brought in the CEOs of all the major oil companies and charged them with the duty of an all-hands collaborative effort to stop the spill and help ward off the damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n• Brought in the best minds in the country, from universities and technology, for emergency efforts to find solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n• Moved quickly to mobilize the National Guard and other military forces, if necessary, ensuring that they received the resources needed to protect our beaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n• Made a clear call to citizen volunteers to help where necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n• Given Cabinet officers an ultimatum: Get this under control in the next 30 days, or else.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be ample time after this disaster for finger-pointing and blame-laying. The key now is to get this spill under control before it does far more damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Washington Post had it exactly right Monday morning when it argued that with the European crisis spreading now beyond Greece, "the knife-edge psychology currently governing global markets has put the future of the U.S. economic recovery in the hands of politicians in an assortment of European capitals."\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross Europe, one finds people stunned at the rapidity with which this crisis has grown, threatening not only their weak economies but also their dreams of a European utopia with people living a honeyed existence. All that could go smash now. Indeed, it is ironic that Europe may now be forced to give up its strong welfare state even as the U.S. is moving toward it. But the immediate point is that the U.S. finds itself too much at the mercy of whether European politicians and publics now make the right moves.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may take a while, but Americans are going to start feeling a lot happier about our country when we once again believe we have strong control of own destiny.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A California movement protesting $1 billion in budget cuts to the state\'s university system appeared to have burgeoned into a nationwide demonstration on Thursday.\n\n\n\nStudents and professors in dozens of states were challenging administrators and state lawmakers over budget cuts and tuition increases that they say are reducing students\' class options and increasing their expenses.\n\n\n\nSome of the demonstrations turned chaotic. In Oakland, California, police arrested 160 protesters who shut down a major freeway, according to city police spokeswoman April McFarland.\n\n\n\nThe Oakland protesters had left a march from the University of California, Berkeley to Oakland City Hall and wound up on the Interstate 980/880 interchange, CNN San Francisco affiliate KGO reported.

He fell from the tree onto the street below, a roughly 22 foot drop from the interchange, according to KGO.\n\n\n\nAt the University of California Davis, police held back student protesters who had threatened to shut down nearby Interstate 80, CNN affiliate KCRA in Sacramento reported.\n\n\n\nPolice fired rubber bullets into the ground in an effort to deter students, who made it as far as an I-80 exit ramp just south of campus.\n\n\n\nAt the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, at least 15 people were arrested in demonstrations Thursday, according to CNN affiliate WTMJ.\n\n\n\nA University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee vice chancellor allowed a protester to drop off pamphlets in the chancellor\'s office, then called campus police when dozens of protesters tried to enter the building, according to WTMJ.\n\n\n\nUniversity police called the Milwaukee Police Department for backup, and officers spent an hour rounding up protesters.\n\n\n\nStudents yelled "Let her go!" and "What did he do?" as Milwaukee police led students into their black and white vans.\n\n\n\nAcross the country, students told of having to work second jobs and make lifestyle adjustments in the face of dramatic tuition hikes.\n\n\n\n"I work at two jobs, go to school full time to make ends meet," said Tyler, a fifth-year senior at San Francisco State University, where students and faculty protested Thursday. She did not give her last name.\n\n\n\n"I have been here a really long time. I struggle to keep [taking] classes to be able to keep my financial aid every semester, and I really don\'t know when I\'m going to be able to get out of here. Every semester, something is cut, and I can\'t get the class I need. Who knows when I will be out of here," she said.\n\n\n\nMany of Thursday\'s demonstrations focused on cuts to state-funded colleges and universities, which supporters say drive up tuition, limit classes and make higher education unobtainable to many. A blog called Student Activism, which was compiling a list of the protests, said that 122 events were scheduled in 33 states -- most on campuses, and some at state capitols.\n\n\n\nAre you taking part in protests? Send photos, videos\n\n\n\nProfessors and students say dissatisfaction, anger and an uncertain future had led to call for a "Day of Action" to defend education.\n\n\n\nAt the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, dozens of protesters gathered Thursday and chanted, "Hey hey, ho ho, these student fees have got to go."\n\n\n\nVideo submitted from the demonstration by a CNN iReporter calling himself Bowtieguy showed students carrying handmade signs with messages like "Where\'s Holub\'s pay cut?" -- a reference to university chancellor Robert C. Holub.\n\n\n\nAnother homemade sign read "Chop from the top."\n\n\n\nAt California State University-Fullerton, dozens of students marched outdoors, chanting, "Students united will never be divided." A video submitted by a CNN iReporter who calls herself MelissaF showed handmade signs saying "Protect humanities" and "What happened to our future?"\n\n\n\nState funding for the California State University system was reduced by nearly $1 billion for the academic years between 2008 and 2010. Schools have responded by increasing fees, canceling classes, cutting student support programs and furloughing professors. Fees have increased 182 percent since 2002. Class waiting lists have doubled or tripled.\n\n\n\n"The less affordable education becomes, the less likely low-income students will be able to get a college education," said Lillian Taiz, president of the California Faculty Association and professor of history at California State University Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nIn addition to protests at numerous public colleges and universities in California, demonstrations also were planned for K-12 schools Thursday, according to the Student Activism blog.\n\n\n\nSee where the protests are happening\n\n\n\nOn the other side of the country, in Georgia, a legislative committee proposed $300 million in cuts to the state\'s college system, on top of the $100 million cut in the past two years, University of Georgia President Michael F. Adams wrote in an open letter to students, faculty and staff.\n\n\n\n"This is not our plan; these are not cuts we offered to make; and we will vigorously oppose any effort to implement them," Adams wrote.\n\n\n\nIn response, student organizers in Georgia are urging fellow students at every college in the state system to wear black this week to "symbolize the \'death\' of our education," according to a post on Facebook.\n\n\n\nIn Colorado, hundreds rallied at the Capitol in Denver, holding signs and cheering.\n\n\n\nWatch students march on Colorado Capitol\n\n\n\nIn New York, students at New York University, which is private, planned to meet up to protest tuition increases and education cuts with students from Hunter College and the New School, two other private institutions in Manhattan, said NYU student Claire Lewis.\n\n\n\n"It is a private university, but like a lot of public universities, our tuition is also getting increased," Lewis said. "This isn\'t anything new with the economic crisis with us; our tuition gets increased an average of 6 percent every year," she said.\n\n\n\n"But lots of our students depend on federally funded grants and loans, and so the broader-nation education cuts definitely affect us." She added, "Kids literally work two or three jobs to pay for their tuition here."\n\n\n\nIn Maryland, students at the University of Maryland in College Park planned to walk out of class at noon, meet at the student union and then march to a plaza for a rally, according to a Facebook invitation.\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Monica Trevino and Dan Simon contributed to this report.', 'qa': [{'question': 'how many reportedly arrested?', 'answers': ['160']}, {'question': 'who did they arrest', 'answers': ['shut down a major freeway,', 'police arrested 160 protesters']}, {'question': 'What did the protestors do?', 'answers': ['threaten to block interstate', 'brought Thursday evening rush hour traffic to a halt for an hour and 45 minutes.', 'shut down a major freeway,']}, {'question': 'in what University arrested?', 'answers': ['of California,']}, {'question': 'How many were arrest in the University of Wisonsin-Milwaukke demonstrations?', 'answers': ['15', 'at least 15 people', 'arrested', '15 people']}, {'question': 'what will raise tuition', 'answers': ['budget cuts']}, {'question': 'What have the duget cuts resulted in?', 'answers': ['nationwide demonstration', 'burgeoned into a nationwide demonstration', "reducing students' class options and increasing their expenses."]}, {'question': 'what reported police?', 'answers': ['San Francisco affiliate KGO']}]}
{'text': '(CNN) -- After meeting a number black couples in crisis, Nisa Muhammad and Dr. Rozario Slack were inspired to create Basic Training for Couples.\n\n\n\nNisa Muhammad, who founded National Black Marriage Day, co-created the Basic Training for Couples program.\n\n\n\nThe eight-week program educates dating, engaged or married couples about the value of commitment, responsibility to the black community, psychological differences between the sexes, sexual intimacy and conflict resolution.  Slack created the male-friendly portion while Muhammad, who founded National Black Marriage Day and the Wedded Bliss Foundation, created the female-friendly portion.\n\n\n\nIn the program, couples also learn about the history of the African-American marriage and many for the first time plot their own family tree to trace marriage and divorces.  The following is rundown of the eight-week course:  Class No. 1: Why marriage?\n\n\n\nThis class teaches the benefits of marriage for men, women, children and the community. It gives the history of marriage in the black community from slavery when marriage was illegal to today\'s trends.\n\n\n\nIcebreaker: Q & A: How couples met?\n\n\n\nHomework:\n\n\n\n1. Choose songs to reflect their love for each other\n\n\n\n2. Marriage family tree\n\n\n\nClass No. 2: From I to we; the sweetness of surrender\n\n\n\nThis class helps couples transition from "I thinking" to "we thinking." It helps them understand the value of making their marriage a priority in their lives.\n\n\n\nClass No. 3: Communication; getting your message understood\n\n\n\nThis class helps couples take responsibility for their communication and teaches skills to improve their communication techniques.\n\n\n\nMain lessons:\n\n\n\n• Respecting differences between men and women\n\n\n\n• Learning to talk to each other and not at each other\n\n\n\n• Format: Teaching session with dialogue.\n\n\n\n• Activity: The talking stick, during conversation only the individual holding the stick can speak.\n\n\n\nClass No. 4: Conflict management\n\n\n\nThis class helps couples understand that conflict needs to be managed, or it will manage you. It helps to normalize some conflict that couples experience with the understanding that some conflict cannot be resolved and can only be managed.\n\n\n\nLessons:\n\n\n\n• This class targets biases. When there\'s a difference of opinions, generally the stronger spouse wants his or her way.\n\n\n\n• How to bring closure to old issues instead of combining them into new issues/conflict.\n\n\n\n• Agree to disagree and not degrade your spouse for having a difference of opinion.\n\n\n\nActivity: Break up into gender groups to discuss current conflicts. The group works out ways to solve the issue\n\n\n\nClass No. 5: Let\'s make love\n\n\n\nWhen the sex is good in a marriage, it\'s only about 20 percent of what\'s going on. When it\'s bad, it\'s a significant problem. This class helps to solve some of those problems.\n\n\n\nThe approach was from a physiological and biological perspective of the differences between the male\'s and female\'s body. Discussion included chemical bonding effect in women and men.\n\n\n\nClass No. 6: From yours and mine to ours\n\n\n\nMany couples in the black community bring children from other relationships to their marriage. This class helps to blend the family into one cohesive unit. It also talks about preventing in-laws from becoming outlaws.\n\n\n\nClass No. 7: Keeping the FIRE burning\n\n\n\nFIRE is an acronym for Faithful, Intimacy, Responsibility and Excitement. This class helps couples maintain the FIRE in their relationship.\n\n\n\nClass No. 8: From this day forward\n\n\n\nThis class helps couples understand the value of commitment in their marriage and never to make divorce an option. They create their own place for success.\n\n\n\nRecap of all the lessons together:\n\n\n\n• Remembering people gravitate to the applause • Ways to appreciate and affirm your spouse • Setting time for just the two of you • Learning to communicate, getting your message heard and understood\n\n\n\nBonus class: Hot monogamy\n\n\n\nGets couples comfortable to discuss sex with their spouse.\n\n\n\nGraduation\n\n\n\nA ceremony of new beginnings, couples testify what the class brought to their marriage over the eight-week period. Lots of emotions and bonding during this time between husbands and wives.\n\n\n\nGraduating couples are encouraged to bring a couple from their community or family who needs help.', 'qa': [{'question': 'where is it held?', 'answers': ['Basic Training for Couples program.']}, {'question': 'What are the consequences of unhealthy relationships where children are concerned?', 'answers': ['from other', 'to their marriage.', 'bring']}, {'question': 'How many weeks is the program?', 'answers': ['eight-week']}, {'question': 'How long is the program?', 'answers': ['eight-week']}, {'question': 'Who created a program for couples?', 'answers': ['Dr. Rozario Slack', 'Nisa Muhammad and Dr. Rozario Slack', 'Nisa Muhammad']}, {'question': 'What is the program for?', 'answers': ['educates dating, engaged or married couples about the value of commitment, responsibility to the black community, psychological differences between the sexes, sexual intimacy and conflict resolution.', 'Couples', 'Basic Training', 'Couples.', 'eight-week']}]}

{'text': 'SAN MIGUEL DEL MONTE, Argentina (CNN) -- In a small farming town 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires, farmers are struggling to nourish their crops and feed their animals. The worst drought in half a century has turned Argentina\'s once-fertile soil to dust and pushed the country into a state of emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\nArgentine farmers profited in years past from selling beef to the world, but some now struggle to feed their cattle.\n\n\n\n\n\nCow carcasses litter the prairie fields and sun-scorched soy plants wither under the South American summer sun. Farmers are concerned about their livelihoods.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I\'m losing money. I can\'t afford to lose money all the time," said Juan Cahen D\'Anvers, whose family has been farming in Argentina since the late 1700s. He owns 700 hectares (1,730 acres) in San Miguel del Monte, where he grows sunflowers and barley.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says this year is one of the hardest he\'s ever had.  Watch farmer explain how hard he\'s been hit »\n\n\n\n\n\n"Production is going to go down a minimum of 50 percent, maybe more. I don\'t know yet," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nArgentina is one of the world\'s breadbaskets, providing commodities such as soy, wheat, corn and beef to countries around the globe. In recent years, record-high prices for these products reaped millions of dollars for Argentine farmers, but since the global economic crisis hit, demand and profits have dropped. Now the drought is making matters even worse.\n\n\n\n\n\nCesar Gioia, another San Miguel del Monte farmer, said time is growing short.\n\n\n\n\n\n"If it doesn\'t rain in the next 10 days, I will have to wipe out my entire corn crop, 90 hectares (220 acres)," he said. "The best I can do with it is feed it to my cows."\n\n\n\n\n\nFacing pressure from farmers, Argentina President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced emergency measures this week that will exempt the worst-hit farmers from paying most taxes for one year.\n\n\n\n\n\n"This is a big boost of patriotism, and a sign of support from all Argentines," Kirchner said on January 26. "All other sectors of the economy will continue to contribute, so we can help the farmers who have been affected by this drought."\n\n\n\n\n\nKirchner has had a contentious relationship with farmers, who staged noisy protests and strikes last year over an increase in export taxes. Those taxes eventually were reduced, but farming leaders still contend that the government is out of touch with their needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey say the measures announced this week fall short, and are demanding a cohesive, long-term plan for dealing with emergencies such as the current drought. If not, they say, they may strike again.  Watch how farmers reacted to Kirchner\'s move »\n\n\n\n\n\n"Sure, this plan is approved now, and it helps, but we need money to feed cows, to go back to planting crops, because this drought is impacting life in every sector of society," said Eduardo Buzzi of the Argentine Agrarian Federation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs she yanks dead soy plant vines from a dusty field in San Miguel del Monte, Lorena del Rios of the Argentina Rural Society says she expects the drought to affect both Argentine and overseas consumers, especially when it comes to Argentina\'s world-famous beef.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We will see less meat available, which means rising prices," she said.

{'text': '(Entertainment Weekly) -- How are the elements of the charming, traditional romantic comedy "The Proposal" like the checklist of a charming, traditional bride? Let me count the ways ...\n\n\n\nRyan Reynolds wonders if marrying his boss, Sandra Bullock, is a good thing in "The Proposal."\n\n\n\nSomething old: The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other -- until they realize they love each other -- is proudly square, in the tradition of rom-coms from the 1940s and \'50s. Or is it straight out of Shakespeare\'s 1590s?\n\n\n\nSandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get ... loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual.\n\n\n\nAnd there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret\'s fatal flaw -- she\'s Canadian. (So is "X-Men\'s" Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.)\n\n\n\nMargaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It\'s an offer the underling can\'t refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie\'s mood.)\n\n\n\nOK, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be\'s family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue.\n\n\n\nSomething new: The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s, Bullock has finessed her dewy America\'s Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature, pearly texture; she\'s lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos, and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe.\n\n\n\nReynolds, meanwhile, is just refining his dry comedy thing, learning to get the most from his deceptive cute-face looks.\n\n\n\nWho knew these two would, hmmm, complete each other? Working together, both are surer and more disciplined in delivering their comedy goods. iReport.com: "Proposal" has "plenty of laughs"\n\n\n\nSomething borrowed: The boisterous family dynamics. The eccentric supporting players (none more extreme than Oscar Nunez from "The Office"). The snappy screwball dialogue in Pete Chiarelli\'s script. And the way Anne Fletcher directs like a camp counselor wrangling bunkmates ... it\'s all been seen before. For a reason. These elements work.\n\n\n\nSomething blue: As the wise and saucy matriarch of the family, the divine 87-year-old Betty White has fun as one hot grandma -- and inspires her younger stars to say "I do," too.\n\n\n\nEW Grade: B+\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly', 'qa': [{'question': 'EW: "The Proposal" is a top-notch what?', 'answers': ['romantic comedy']}, {'question': 'What is a top-notch romantic comedy?', 'answers': ['"The Proposal"']}, {'question': "What adheres to formula, but it's well done, very funny ?", 'answers': ['"The Proposal"']}, {'question': 'What does the movie adhere to?', 'answers': ['rom-coms', 'the charming, traditional romantic comedy']}, {'question': 'The movie adheres to what?', 'answers': ['traditional romantic comedy', 'checklist of a charming, traditional bride?']}]}

It is available to all Comcast customers, so long as they subscribe to both Internet and Cable service.\n\n\n\nHeard said he doesn\'t expect to give up Hulu, though many of the same episodes and Web clips will be available on Fancast.\n\n\n\nHeard, trying out the site Tuesday after it went live, tweeted that he thought the service was "awesome," and he finally had a place where he could watch the entire series of "The Sopranos."\n\n\n\n"The quality, it\'s really clear and loads fast," he said, though he noted there were still some bugs in the product.\n\n\n\nHeard occasionally had to reload the site, and felt that installing the video player and authorizing the computer took a bit more time and was harder than simply pressing play on Hulu.\n\n\n\nThe service is getting mixed reviews on Twitter, with customers giving instant feedback about their experiences.\n\n\n\nSome complained that high-definition videos, which are available on Hulu, are not available on Comcast\'s service. Others complained about having to download a separate video player, the service not being compatible with the Linux operating system, and only being able to authorize the service on a total of three computers.\n\n\n\nComcast hopes to wow customers even more in the future. In the next six months, after the service has gone through more beta testing, the company plans to open the service to a broader customer base.\n\n\n\nCustomers will be able to access all content -- depending on the tiered level of service they subscribe to. Those not paying for HBO regularly, for example, won\'t be able to snag the newest episode of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" online.\n\n\n\nIn addition to catching up with sites like Hulu and Clicker, Comcast executives told media outlets they expect to serve up a feature that Tivo fans have come to love -- allowing customers to program their DVR from afar.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Israeli President Shimon Peres said he had an amicable phone conversation with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a day after Erdogan stormed offstage during an angry exchange with Peres at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTurkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan leaves the stage Thursday, as Israeli President Shimon Peres sits, left.\n\nPeres said he and Erdogan did not take the spat personally.\n\n"I called him up and said, yes, it\'s nothing against you, nothing against Turkey. We consider you as a friend," Peres said. He said Erdogan reciprocated.\n\nAlthough there was no mention of an apology, Peres said there was a polite exchange between the two leaders.\n\n"I didn\'t take it personally. I didn\'t go for a personal fight. I answered unfounded accusations. It was my duty. And they didn\'t change my mind," he said.  Watch Shimon Peres on the Gaza conflict Â»\n\nTurkey, a predominantly Muslim nation, has long been the Jewish state\'s closest military and economic partner in the region, and Turkey recently mediated indirect peace talks between Israel and Syria.\n\nBut many Turks have been incensed with Israel over its three-week military operation that ended there earlier this month.\n\nAnd in Davos, Erdogan was angered after Peres said that Israel is committed to peace and blamed Hamas for the fighting in Gaza, where Israel staged a three-week military operation that ended earlier this month.\n\nWhen Erdogan began responding, a moderator cut him off, saying the debate had run over its allotted time. Erdogan patted the moderator on the arm until he was granted one more minute to respond.  Watch commentary on Erdogan\'s angry exchange Â»\n\n"I know the reason behind raising your voice is because of the guilty psychology," he said to Peres. "My voice will not be that loud. You must know that. When it comes to killing -- you know killing very well. I know how you hit, kill children on the beaches."\n\nHe then left the stage, complaining that Peres was receiving preferential treatment.\n\n"From now on, Davos is finished for me," Erdogan said. "I will not come back. You won\'t let people talk. You gave him 25 minutes, but you gave me 12 minutes. This is not right."\n\nErdogan had described the military campaign against Hamas fighters in Gaza as "barbaric" and accused Israel of using excessive force.\n\nHe said: "The Palestinian Territories are like an open-air prison, isolated from the world. I have always been a leader who said anti-Semitism is a crime against humanity. But so is anti-Islamism."\n\nPeres had said Hamas was responsible for the "tragedy," accusing the Islamist militants of creating a "dangerous dictatorship."\n\n"Israel left Gaza completely -- no occupation," Peres said. "I want to understand why they throw rockets at us."\n\nOn Friday, after his outburst, Erdogan returned home to a hero\'s welcome.

{'text': "(CNN) -- Arsenal climbed to the top of the English Premier League with a 2-0 victory over London rivals West Ham despite playing half of Saturday's clash with only 10 men.\n\n\n\n\n\nArsene Wenger's team moved a point above champions Manchester United, who host Liverpool on Sunday, while Chelsea dropped to third ahead of their trip to Blackburn. Carlo Ancelotti's side can join Arsenal on 67 points with victory in that game.\n\n\n\n\n\nGianfranco Zola's West Ham team were left to rue a missed penalty as the defeat left them just three points above the relegation zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nArsenal, who on Friday were handed a chance to avenge 2006's Champions League final defeat by Barcelona in the upcoming quarterfinals, took the lead after just five minutes in the rain at the Emirates Stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazil midfielder Denilson fired in a low shot for his sixth goal this season, having dispossessed Valon Behrami and then played a neat one-two on the edge of the area with striker Nicklas Bendtner.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Arsenal could not turn their dominance into further goals, and West Ham should have leveled just before halftime when Belgium defender Thomas Vermaelen was sent off as his nudge in the back of Guillermo Franco saw the Mexico striker tumble in the box.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Alessandro Diamanti saw his penalty saved by Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, and the hosts also escaped in the second half when substitute striker Carlton Cole saw his fierce low shot hit the outside of the post.\n\n\n\n\n\nArsenal captain Cesc Fabregas made the points safe on his return from injury five minutes after that with a penalty on 82, as England defender Matthew Upson paid the price for deliberately blocking the Spain midfielder's clever little flick with his arm.\n\n\n\n\n\nTottenham consolidated fourth place with a hard-fought 2-1 victory at 10-man Stoke, as substitute Eidur Gudjohnsen came off the bench to put the London club ahead before Dean Whitehead was sent off and then helped set up Niko Kranjcar's 77th-minute winner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe on-loan Iceland forward netted just 18 seconds after halftime having come on for Roman Pavlyuchenko, who joined England striker Jermain Defoe on the injured list after suffering a hamstring problem in the first half.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitehead went three minutes later for his second booking, but Stoke leveled on 64 as winger Matthew Etherington scored from the penalty spot against his former club after fullback Benoit Assou-Ekotto fouled striker Paul Kitson.\n\n\n\n\n\nGudjohnsen's dummy allowed Croatia midfielder Kranjcar to put the Londoners four points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool, who will have played one more match after Sunday's trip to bitter North-West rivals United.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe victory was doubly important for Tottenham after fellow Champions League hopefuls Aston Villa had to come from behind to snatch a 2-2 draw with lowly Wolverhampton in the Midlands derby earlier on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Carew put Villa ahead in the 16th minute despite appearing to be offside, and the Norway striker salvaged a point for the hosts with eight minutes remaining as he steered Steve Sidwell's low shot into the visitors' net for his 13th league goal this season.\n\n\n\n\n\nWolves moved four points clear of the bottom three, but were denied a first win at Villa Park in 30 years despite Jody Craddock's bundled 23rd-minute equalizer and an own-goal from England international James Milner seven minutes before halftime.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result left Villa in seventh, having played one less game than Tottenham, equal on 50 points with Manchester City, who travel to Fulham on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nEverton moved above Birmingham into eighth place with a 2-0 win at home to Bolton, who had Gretar Steinsson sent off in the 71st minute for bringing down Nigeria striker Yakubu.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanish midfielder Mikel Arteta fired in the resulting freekick and South Africa international Steven Pienaar wrapped up victory with a minute to go after Leon Osman hit the crossbar.\n\n\n\n\n\nBirmingham crashed 3-1 at Sunderland, who eased their relegation worries as England World Cup hopeful Darren Bent scored twice in the first 11 minutes to take his Premier League tally to 20 goals this season and 21 overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nWigan moved seven points clear of the bottom three with a 1-0 win over Burnley, as Colombia striker Hugo Rodallega's 90th-minute header left the visitors deep in relegation trouble after a 15th defeat in 16 away matches.\n\n\n\n\n\nHull remain second from bottom, behind Burnley on goal difference, as new manager Iain Dowie suffered a heartbreaking 3-2 defeat at basement club Portsmouth in his match in charge.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visitors led 2-1 with 17 minutes to play after two goals from striker Caleb Folan, but Portsmouth's on-loan midfielder Jamie O'Hara leveled in the 88th minute with a curled free-kick and the Nigerian veteran Kanu netted a late winner.\n\n\n\n\n\nPortsmouth are still set to be relegated after being docked nine points for going into administration, now 14 points from

{'text': '(CNN) -- "It was booked as a Kids in the Hall tour, but the stages were too small."\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin McDonald explains -- as only he can -- his current U.S. comedy act with Scott Thompson. They\'re calling it "Two Kids, One Hall."\n\n\n\n\n\n"They could only fit two-and-a-half of us," he says, "So we fired two-and-a-half, and the other guy didn\'t want to come as a half. After some contract negotiation, it became Scott and I."\n\n\n\n\n\nLongtime fans of the legendary Canadian sketch comedy group know the full cast as also including Dave Foley, Bruce McCulloch and Mark McKinney. (McDonald didn\'t specify which of these three was asked to be half a man on the tour, but the smart money is on Foley.)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1989 to 1995, the Kids in the Hall enjoyed TV success, and many of their sketches and phrases have become a part of pop culture lore. For instance, if you\'ve ever crushed somebody\'s head, you, sir, have enjoyed a Kids in the Hall moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\'s plenty more from their catalog of absurdity, and you can pretty much find them all somewhere on the Interwebs. But if you\'re looking for a place to start, this author\'s personal favorite is a sketch called "Citizen Kane." And my friend Paul favors one called "Wrong Number." So, here, now, you have some Kids in the Hall advice from somebody named Paul, and somebody with the last name Bellini.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to touch us.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being known for their sketches, the current Scott Thompson/Kevin McDonald tour is actually more focused on stand-up comedy. Thompson says, "I never liked it until very recently. I always felt too exposed and out of control."\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\'s definitely something new for Thompson and McDonald, and, perhaps, even more new for their fans. But the chemistry between the two comedians comes out best when they share the stage during moments throughout the show. And it certainly came out when we sat down with them in Atlanta before their performances at The Punchline. As you\'ll see in our video, Thompson and McDonald feed off each other with ease, often completing each other\'s thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\nCertainly, like all comedy, the Kids in the Hall aren\'t for everyone, but there\'s no denying their success; especially if catching the eye of a young Uma Thurman is the barometer of that success.\n\n\n\n\n\nThompson recalls meeting her backstage after a show early in the group\'s career.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Uma Thurman at the time was the sexiest woman in the world," he says. "We had never met a celebrity before. We all thought she wanted to sleep with us. It really was a big launching pad for us. It made us think that wow, we\'re in the big leagues.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A 14-year-old Filipino-American boy abducted in July by suspected Islamic militants in the Philippines is free, officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Lunsmann was reunited with his mother, the U.S. Embassy in Manila said Monday, without offering additional details.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It was a tough time. It was a tough five months," Kevin\'s father, Heiko, told CNN affiliate WSET, from the family home in Lynchburg, Virginia. "I\'m just so happy."\n\n\n\n\n\nHeiko Lunsmann said the boy had plotted his escape for a while and eventually seized the opportunity some time late last week while his guards slept.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe "was spotted alone" Saturday about six miles southwest of Lamitan City on the island of Basilan, a stronghold of the Islamic militant group Abu Sayyaf, the official Philippines News Agency said.\n\n\n\n\n\nArmy officials turned him over to American forces in the southern Mindanao region, the Philippine government said in a statement to CNN affiliate TV 5.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Philippine Inquirer quoted the Lamitan city mayor, Roderick Furigay, as saying Kevin walked for two days, surviving on candies his captors presumably gave him and on coconuts that he retrieved by climbing trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n"In this holiday season nothing makes me happier than knowing that an innocent victim is returned to his family in time for holiday celebrations," Harry Thomas, the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, said in a weekend statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n"If ever we are to be inspired by the human spirit, we should take comfort in the courage, commitment and love that the Lunsmann family exhibited during this trying ordeal," Thomas added.\n\n\n\n\n\nFourteen gunmen snatched Kevin, his mother, Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann, and his 19-year-old cousin, Romnick Jakaria, in July while they vacationed on the island of Tictabon, authorities said. The abductors forced them to board awaiting boats, which then sped off in the direction of Basilan.\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin\'s mother was released by her captors in October. Jakaria was released last month, according to the news agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nBasilan serves as a base for Abu Sayyaf, which wants to establish a separate state for the Philippines\' minority Muslim population. The U.S. State Department considers the group a terrorist organization and says it is linked to al Qaeda. The Philippines government has been fighting to contain the militants.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbu Sayyaf has been blamed for several terrorist attacks in the Philippines, including the bombing of a ferry in 2004 that left about 130 people dead, as well as past kidnappings.\n\n\n\n\n\nBasilan\'s governor called on authorities Sunday to prosecute the alleged kidnappers of the Lunsmann family, according to the news agency.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The prosecution of kidnappers by a court of law will put a stop to kidnappings," the news agency quoted Jum Akbar as saying.\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas, the U.S. ambassador, said the crime will not go "unpunished."\n\n\n\n\n\nGerfa Lunsmann was adopted by Americans when she was 9 and grew up in Virginia. She eventually married a German citizen. Both she and the son, Kevin, are U.S. passport holders.\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin\'s father told WSET that the boy will eventually share his story of escape, but did not say when.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I can tell you a lot of things, but I only know that he is a hero," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about this story from CNN affiliate WSET.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What did Kevins father tell cnn', 'answers': ['"I\'m just so happy."', '"It was a tough time.

{'text': 'LONDON, England (CNN) -- While the Oscars is without doubt the grandest of all the awards ceremonies, it doesn\'t have the world stage to itself.\n\n\n\n"Persepolis" won the French nomination -- but failed to make the Academy\'s shortlist\n\n\n\nIn London, the Brits have their BAFTAs; Spain has the Goyas; and France celebrates the Cesars, where "La Vie En Rose" won six out of its "magnifique" 11 nominations. And it was this foreign fare that gave rise to the biggest controversy at Hollywood\'s big event.\n\n\n\n"La Vie En Rose" amassed an impressive eleven nominations at the French Cesar Awards. Marion Cotillard\'s astonishing transformation into Edith Piaf won her Best Actress gongs at the Golden Globes, BAFTAs and the Academy Awards. But "La Vie En Rose" was not among the contenders for Best Foreign Film.\n\n\n\nAnother French language film, "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly," was on many critics\' top ten lists for the films of 2007. It won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film and its American director Julian Schnabel was nominated for an Oscar. But like "La Vie En Rose," this film was not among the contenders for Best Foreign Film.\n\n\n\nA third French film, "Persepolis" won the special jury prize at Cannes and it received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature, but yet again, this was not a nominee for Best Foreign Film.\n\n\n\nFrance suffered through an abundance of riches this year, with three potential Oscar winners. But to enter the race for Best Foreign film, France, like every other country, had to nominate just one.\n\n\n\nSo "La Vie En Rose" and "Diving Bell" were rejected by the French film authorities in favor of "Persepolis." But "Persepolis" didn\'t sufficiently impress the Oscar judges: so France had no films among the final five nominees.\n\n\n\nFrench frustration at the Oscar process was echoed in Taiwan, which chose Ang Lee\'s film, "Lust Caution," as its official entry. The film won both critical acclaim and the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. But Oscar judges ruled there was too little Taiwanese involvement -- none of the lead actors are from Taiwan. The double Oscar winning director watched in disbelief as his film was banned and Taiwan was told to pick another film instead: Oscar caution triumphing over Ang Lee\'s lust for a third Academy Award.\n\n\n\nAnd the list goes on: the Israeli film, "The Band\'s Visit" was excluded for having too much English -- but it\'s the only way the Israeli and Egyptian protagonists can communicate in the film and is a key part of the plot. But Israel submitted "Beaufort" instead -- and made the final five.\n\n\n\n"The Kite Runner" may have proved an international success at the box office, but it didn\'t fly with Oscar watchdogs. Set in Afghanistan with Farsi as its main language, it fell foul of the rulebook by having too little Afghan involvement and a Swiss-American director.\n\n\n\nBut for most critics, the most inexplicable omission from the shortlist of nominees was Romania\'s "4 Months, 3 weeks & 2 Days," winner of the Palme D\'Or in Cannes and considered by many to be a sure-fire Oscar winner. Some feel its challenging subject of a back-street abortion in communist Romania was too testing for conservative members of the Academy\'s Foreign Film Committee, whose volunteers tend to include many retirees -- who else has time to attend screenings of 63 foreign language films?\n\n\n\nEven Marc Johnson, the Chairman of the Academy\'s Foreign Language Film Committee, acknowledged that some of the criticism levelled against the Academy this year was "justifiable".\n\n\n\nHe told CNN: "We took quite a beating, and I think quite justifiably, not for the films that we selected but for the films that we DIDN\'T select.\n\n\n\n"And I felt very passionately about it and spoke out about it more than I should have done, but there was a part of me saying "wait a minute I didn\'t sign on for this -- I didn\'t sign on to be the scapegoat and we received a lot of criticism and yet it\'s something I feel so passionately about I think foreign language film and particularly subtitled film in the U.S. are really an endangered species."\n\n\n\nDefenders of the Academy also point out that they\'re only asking countries to nominate their favorite film; they then pick the best of that bunch.\n\n\n\nMr Johnson said it would be unfair to allow countries to submit more than one film as the selection process would become "unmanageable".\n\n\n\n"There have been arguments that why can\'t a coutnry submit more films? France for instance might argue we make 50 films a year, maybe five of them are Oscar worthy and Ecuador maybe only makes one why is it we have the same group as they?" .\n\n\n\n"Not that I ever like to mix sports with the arts but it\'s a little bit like the World Cup. Brazil could probably submit five teams but they\'re only allowed to submit one -- and it\'s what makes it a fair race," he explains.\n\n\n\n"The other thing is quite frankly this year we had 63 films. We could not see many more than that. So if we had 5 from this country and 3 from this country it would be completely unmanageable."\n\n\n\nAnd while the one-film-per-country rule fails to reward a nation with a flourishing film industry, it does ensure diversity: no less than 63 countries from Azerbaijan to Vietnam submitted films for the 80th Academy Awards.\n\n\n\nIsrael, Austria, Poland, Russia, and Kazakhstan -- representing 210 million people in all -- were the countries vying for the prize on Oscar night, and the Academy points to the quality of those on the list, rather those that are not, as ultimate proof that the system works.

He was among several employees who told investigators they last saw Wiles on April 1, 2008, at the office and had no clue what happened to him.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FBI won\'t reveal the suspected motive or why agents believe it was Holt who left a uniquely signed ransom note demanding money two days after Wiles disappeared.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, agents said Wiles\' father tried to comply with the demand to get back his son, but heard nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHolt is described as an employee who, at least at one time, had a supervisory role at the company.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities say he now works as a contract employee doing similar flight maintenance work at Patrick Air Force base near Cape Canaveral in Florida.\n\n\n\n\n\nWiles was single. When he vanished without a trace, fellow employees said they were stunned.\n\n\n\n\n\n"All that he ever worked on was customer relations. Making things better for the company," co-worker Jerry Grief said at the time.

Dick Mackey\'s one-second win over Rick Swenson in 1978 set a record for the closest finish in Iditarod history.\n\n\n\nThe Iditarod, though, isn\'t a competitive sprint to the finish for every musher in the field. Jim Lanier, 69, of Chugiak, Alaska, mushes primarily for enjoyment. He\'s entered and completed 13 Iditarods, at least one in all four decades the race has been in existence. He has never won.\n\n\n\nRookie Iditarod musher Kristy Berington admits that she\'s not racing to win; she just hopes to finish. Her longest race prior to entering this year\'s Iditarod was only 300 miles.\n\n\n\n"I\'ve got puppies on this team that I want to see get to Nome. It\'s like watching your kid graduate from college," said the 25-year-old Kasilof, Alaska, resident. "They go and they\'re puppies, and they come back and they\'re dogs."\n\n\n\nShe has been training with Iditarod veteran Paul Gebhardt and has borrowed one of his dog teams to lead her to Nome.\n\n\n\nOutside of personal accomplishments and goals, the race this year also presents an opportunity for some mushers to show their respect to fallen serviceman, thanks to a collaboration with the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors.\n\n\n\nAlways a top competitor in the race, four-time Iditarod champion Martin Buser of Big Lake, Alaska, has six commemorative purple ribbons attached to his sled this year, placed there at the ceremonial start by the wives of the fallen soldiers and officers.\n\n\n\nBuser, who was born in Switzerland in 1958, became a U.S. citizen in 2002.\n\n\n\n"After the 9/11 incident, I proved to my boys that this is the soil I wanted to defend ... so being asked to do such honors as these are very, very important to me because I\'m truly one of the new immigrants and one of the staunches believers in our country," he said.\n\n\n\nBuser was naturalized under the famous burled arch in Nome at the finish line of the 2002 Iditarod. He carried an American flag in his sled for more than 1,000 miles to the finish line that year and set an Iditarod record for the shortest race time ever recorded: 8 days, 22 hours, 46 minutes and 2 seconds.\n\n\n\nHis two sons are even named after Iditarod checkpoints: Nikolai and Rohn.\n\n\n\nThe 2010 Iditarod musher\'s roster includes men and women ages 18 to 69 who hail from five countries: the United States, Canada, Scotland, Belgium and Jamaica. Some are professional mushers who raise and train sled dogs year-round; others are teachers, nurses, horse trainers, foresters or biologists. A doctor and a fishing guide also are included, among other professions.\n\n\n\nAsked to explain why mushers are drawn to this sport, four-time Iditarod champion Jeff King of Denali Park, Alaska, took time to reflect before answering.\n\n\n\n"Until you\'ve ridden a dog team you\'ve trained from puppies on a full moon with a hard trail and feel their energy and hear the panting of their tongues, the jingle of their collars, feel the surge of power that comes through the handlebar, I don\'t think you can appreciate what it\'s really like," the 54-year-old said.

{'text': '(CNN) -- William Beach was one of those people who fixated on certain foods. He would eat the same thing voraciously for a few days, and then, when he tired of the same tastes, he moved onto something else.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August, when summer\'s heat seemed unending in Mustang, Oklahoma, Beach took to savoring fried chicken -- and soft, sweet cantaloupe.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeach was elderly -- 87 -- but after eating the fruit, his health declined rather suddenly and before anyone in his family knew what was wrong, he was dead.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is among 15 people who died from Listeria monocytogenes in what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is calling the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998.\n\n\n\n\n\nGallery: The decade\'s 10 biggest food-borne illness outbreaks\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bacteria was traced to Rocky Ford cantaloupes grown at Jensen Farms\' fields in Granada, Colorado. As of Monday, the outbreak had affected people in 19 states.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CDC first reported it publicly on September 12, six days after William Beach\'s family buried him.\n\n\n\n\n\nListeria? What\'s that?\n\n\n\n\n\nBeach and his wife Monette bought the tainted cantaloupe at a Homeland grocery, where the store motto says: "the best is fresh."\n\n\n\n\n\nA week after he ate the fruit, Beach felt malaise, perhaps not unusual for a man of 87 years. But then his face turned the shade of a tomato. Soon he had trouble breathing and collapsed on the living room floor, according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed against Jensen Farms.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonette heard him struggling to pull himself up off the floor.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe hobbled into the room with her cane and saw her husband of 67 years unable to speak, unable to get up.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe dialed 911 and an ambulance whisked Beach to Baptist Hospital in nearby Oklahoma City. He was discharged the next day but when he got worse at home, he returned to the hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of Beach\'s six daughters, Brenda Hathaway met her father at the emergency room. Beach told her he didn\'t want Monette to see him this way.\n\n\n\n\n\nListeriosis causes fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. It is rarely a serious concern for healthy children and adults, according to the CDC, but it is particularly dangerous for pregnant women and the elderly or people with weakened immune systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the evening of September 1, medical staff tried to intubate Beach but he began hemorrhaging from the mouth and nose, the court documents said. Soon after, he died.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonette never saw her husband alive again. Two days after his funeral, an official from the Oklahoma State Department of Health called Hathaway.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was told then that her father had tested positive for Listeria.\n\n\n\n\n\nHathaway\'s sister Debbie Frederick said the family wondered why it took the hospital two days to release her father\'s body. They had assumed he died of natural causes.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We knew it was some sort of infection, but we did not know what it was," she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Listeria? She had never even heard that word before.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you need to know about Listeria\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth officials began questioning Beach\'s daughters. What had he eaten in the weeks prior? They specifically asked if he had consumed cantaloupes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrederick, meanwhile, glued herself to her computer, determined to learn more about the illness that killed her father.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Doing all that reading, it became patently clear that the health departments knew there was an issue," she said. "They knew there was a Listeria problem."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Beach family\'s angst led to a lawsuit filed against Jensen Farms. Frederick said she hopes the lawsuit will help strengthen food safety laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It\'s a terrible thing to lose someone you love to something that could be prevented," she said. "I pray that it\'s over. I hope nobody else has to lose a loved one."\n\n\n\n\n\nBattling the bacteria\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Littleton, Colorado, Jeni Exley\'s parents, Herbert and Elaine Stevens, were getting ready to celebrate 60 years of marriage on September 8.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey still had a good life together. Despite his age -- 84 -- he felt spry enough to take the dogs out for a walk in their Littleton neighborhood. He let Elaine do most of the grocery shopping and cooking but he could make his own sandwiches for lunch.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to keep your food safe\n\n\n\n\n\nIn early August, Elaine came home from the nearby King Soopers market with half a Jensen Farms cantaloupe. She didn\'t buy the whole thing -- it was only the two of them. Besides, she liked to able to see through the cellophane and decide if it was ripe enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe and Herbert both ate the lush fruit. Herbert started to feel sick, just like William Beach.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour days before Beach was rushed to hospital in Oklahama, Stevens couldn\'t get up from the toilet in Colorado. He had a fever of 103 degrees and felt nauseous.\n\n\n\n\n\nElaine called an ambulance which ferried her husband to Littleton Adventist Hospital. Unlike the Beach family, Stevens\' daughters learned after a few days that their father was infected with Listeria.\n\n\n\n\n\nExley, 55, like Frederick, went online to learn more about the bacteria that had sickened her father. Health officials, after questioning Elaine about what the couple had eaten in the last few weeks, determined that Herbert Stevens was a part of the latest outbreak.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter antibiotic therapy, Stevens was transferred to a nursing home. Exley arrived on her parents anniversary with chocolate milkshakes in hand. But her father wasn\'t feeling well. He was sent back to the hospital when his condition worsened.\n\n\n\n\n\nStevens eventually regained some of his strength. He was sent to a skilled nursing facility to recuperate on September 19, the same day that the Food and Drug Administration announced it had found Listeria monocytogenes in samples of Jensen Farms\' Rocky Ford cantaloupes.\n\n\n\n\n\nStevens\' Listeria is gone but at that age, he will probably never return to the man he was, Exley said. A little bit of him went with his bout with the bacteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe uses a walker now to move around; all his body functions seem affected, Exley said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I think it is amazing that he even survived," she said. "I am surprised he is not one of those people who died."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stevens are also suing Jensen Farms in hopes of recouping some of their medical costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nExley, who loves cantaloupe, feels extremely lucky her family escaped tragedy. She, too, had bought some of the tainted fruit and received an automated phone call at home warning her about the recall.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe, like Frederick, thought she could trust what she was buying at the neighborhood grocery store. From now on, she will think twice.

{'text': 'Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- After the Republicans and Democrats met at the White House summit on health care, it was clear that the parties are very far away from a bipartisan agreement. Indeed, few participants walked away with the sense that they were any closer to a deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House did make clear that it was willing to move forward on health care without Republican support. The choice now becomes whether Democrats should use the budget reconciliation process to pass some parts of health care legislation. According to recent reports, Democrats are considering having the House pass the bill that was already approved in the Senate and then dealing with a package of additional reforms through reconciliation.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrograms that are considered under the reconciliation process are not subject to a Senate filibuster. Democrats would only need 51 votes, not 60, to pass those parts of the bill that are included under reconciliation.\n\n\n\n\n\nReconciliation was created through the Budget Reform Act of 1974 in an effort to streamline the budget process, strengthen the ability of Congress to make tough decisions regarding deficits, and to make legislative decision-making more efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\nCongress quickly expanded on the types of measures that could be considered under reconciliation until 1985 and 1986, when the Senate passed rules proposed by Sen. Robert Byrd that limited what could or could not be included when using this process.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore moving forward, Democrats must consider two questions. The first is whether using reconciliation to pass health care is legitimate or an abuse of the process. Republicans have charged that this would be akin to forcing the program through the chamber rather than passing the bill through negotiation and compromise.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn this question, the answer is easy. Reconciliation has been as much a part of the Senate in the past three decades as the filibuster. According to an article that was published in The New Republic, Congress passed 22 reconciliation bills between 1980 and 2008. Many important policy changes were enacted through this process, including the Children\'s Health Insurance Program, COBRA (which allows people who switch jobs to keep their health care), student aid reform, expansions in Medicaid and several major tax cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\'s Julie Rovner reported that most of the health care reforms enacted in the past two decades have gone through reconciliation. President Ronald Reagan was one of the first presidents to make aggressive use of reconciliation when he pushed through his economic program in 1981. Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker said then that speed had been essential because "Every day that this is delayed makes it more difficult to pass. This is an extraordinary proposal, and these are extraordinary times."\n\n\n\n\n\nPresidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush all used reconciliation as well. It is worth noting that these presidents, particularly George W. Bush, also made use of sweeping executive power to circumvent Congress altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second question is more difficult and it involves perceptions. If the Democratic leadership wants to use this tactic, they have to convince enough members of their own party that this won\'t scare off independent voters. This argument was harder to make in 2009 than in 2010. But after a year of dealing with paralysis in the Senate and highly effective Republican obstruction, more Democrats are coming on board.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leadership must be proactive in responding to the criticism about reconciliation. They will have to explain that reconciliation is a legitimate process by pointing to the history.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey will also have to connect the dots for voters frustrated with the ineffective government by explaining that the constant use of the filibuster has turned the Senate into a supermajority institution where both parties have found it extraordinarily difficult -- virtually impossible -- to pass major legislation.On this point, Republicans and Democrats actually agree.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, as Democrats make this decision, Kentucky Republican Senator Jim Bunning is objecting to a unanimous consent order and single-handedly preventing the Senate from passing an important bill to assist unemployed workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats must also convince hesitant colleagues that the payoff could be greater than the cost. While, in the short-term, Republicans will complain that their opponents have rammed through social policy in some sort of unnatural procedural move, Democrats are facing these kinds of intense attacks anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\nRight now, Democrats are receiving the brunt of Republican attacks without being able to pass much legislation. If they pass health care, they will be able to respond to the arguments of the GOP, not just by complaining that Republicans obstruct everything, but by pointing to specific benefits such as lowering premiums by expanding how many people purchase coverage and bringing tens of millions of Americans into the health care system.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn certain respects, the White House made the use of reconciliation more difficult by initially accepting the notion that 60 votes were needed to pass legislation through the Senate. After the election of Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, a decision to refocus on procedures that only depend on 51 votes makes it more vulnerable to the attacks of manipulating the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in other respects, the administration now has a better political opportunity to use reconciliation. After a year, the public has seen just how dysfunctional Senate procedures can be in an era when filibusters are common.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a public that is frustrated by Washington, as the polls show, the Democrats might be able to persuade a sufficient number of their colleagues to go along. If they don\'t, one thing is for certain: Democrats will go into election day facing voters who are hearing all the complaints about their party but seeing very little in terms of what they can deliver on health care.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E.

He did not attend the week-long conference in Dharamsala, a town in the hills of north India where he lives in exile. He called the meeting, he said, to offer the exiles an opportunity to discuss "the best possible future course of action" for Tibet.\n\n\n\nTakhla said the Tibetans demonstrated that the Dalai Lama was their undisputed leader, and they hoped China would recognize him as such and negotiations toward a realistic solution could be held.\n\n\n\nThere was a small minority who said they wanted to demand Tibet\'s independence, Takhla said.\n\n\n\nThe "middle way" approach with Beijing is one in which Tibetans want a level of autonomy that will allow them to protect and preserve their culture, religion and national identity.

{'text': '(CNN) -- The power of the Mexican military was on full display Tuesday in Ciudad Juarez, where police reported the third consecutive day without a drug slaying.\n\n\n\nA federal police officer guards a checkpoint earlier this month in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico\n\n\n\nTen drug-related killings in a single day were common before 9,500 army troops poured into the blood-soaked border town in the past few weeks, said Mauricio Mauricio, a spokesman for the Juarez municipal police.\n\n\n\n"It\'s a much more secure city at this moment," he said. "We haven\'t had murders with the same regularity and frequency as before."\n\n\n\nBut as President Obama\'s administration announced plans Tuesday to beef up U.S. security along its border with Mexico, there are questions about whether increased military and police efforts in both nations can yield long-term results.\n\n\n\nMexico has been spiraling into a deepening pit of violence, with 6,500 people killed in 2008 and the body count continuing apace this year. Most of that violence is occurring along the border, which worries Washington.\n\n\n\nMexican President Felipe Calderon and others have said recently that the United States must share responsibility because the demand for drugs and most of the weapons used by drug cartels comes from north of the border.\n\n\n\nThe drug war and security will be a major topic when U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits Mexico on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\n\nAndrew Selee, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center\'s Mexico Institute, called Obama\'s pledge on Tuesday to give $700 million in aid to Mexico and assign an additional 360 staff along the border a "substantive commitment" that shows the United States is serious about attacking the problem.\n\n\n\n"It\'s an attempt to really put some substance behind the idea of shared responsibility," Selee said. "They finally committed some of the resources they said they would to this."\n\n\n\nSuccess will depend on the follow-through, he said.\n\n\n\n"Now is the hard part," he said. "It\'s not easy to follow the money trail or stop the weapons or the criminal networks."\n\n\n\nOthers say the Obama plan falls short.\n\n\n\nLarry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington policy institute, calls it a "militarized strategy" that isn\'t oriented toward finding solutions based on economic development or social justice programs.\n\n\n\n"This is a feel-good strategy that is meant to produce the illusion of concrete developments taking place when it\'s actually just really more of the same," Birns said. "You\'re talking about a 2,000-mile border, so the odd 16 [agents] here or 12 there is not going to do the trick."\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Mexico\'s major military commitment is certainly showing short-term benefits.\n\n\n\nBefore the army arrived in Ciudad Juarez, there had been more than 400 drug killings this year, police spokesman Mauricio said. Since the army arrived, slayings have dropped 95 percent, he said.\n\n\n\nPeter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue policy institute, says Mexico\'s use of the army in Juarez -- and its evident success -- "shows that Mexico is definitely not a failed state. Nobody is going to challenge the government for control of a certain area."\n\n\n\nSelee sees it as "increased determination from the Mexican government to establish order."\n\n\n\nBut there are limitations to using the military in Mexico, Birns and Hakim said.\n\n\n\n"There\'s bad blood that exists between local communities and the military," said Birns. "The Mexican military has not fought a war for years. It\'s enemy has always been the local population."\n\n\n\nHakim noted the cost in money, and to the daily fabric of life.\n\n\n\n"That\'s not a cheap way of keeping law and order," he said. "It does a great deal of harm to civilian institutions. The military is not trained to respect human liberties and individual rights."\n\n\n\nIt\'s an ambivalence that many Mexicans feel: security versus liberties.\n\n\n\nPolls consistently show that security is the top concern among a vast majority of Mexicans. And for many Mexican citizens, the drug war can still hit close to home no matter how far away they live from the front lines.\n\n\n\nAdrian Jesus Garrido Gomez, a 30-year-old bank loan officer with a wife and two young sons, lives in Tabasco state in southern Mexico, far from the violence tearing up Juarez and other border cities.\n\n\n\n"Tabasco has always been relatively safe," Garrido said by telephone Tuesday.\n\n\n\nHe said a childhood friend worked for 2½ years in a high-paying white-collar job in Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas. When he got married recently, his wife had one request: Let\'s move back to Tabasco. They did, six months ago.\n\n\n\n"For them, it (was) very insecure," Garrido said.\n\n\n\nReynosa was the site of a four-hour gun battle last month that left five drug traffickers dead and seven police wounded. People worldwide saw video of a television reporter sprawled on a bridge during that fight, trying to file an on-air report over the roar of gunfire.\n\n\n\nHakim says Mexican President Calderon\'s efforts to paint the United States as partially responsible for the violence is lost on some Mexicans.\n\n\n\n"In the end," Hakim said, "this is Mexico\'s problem as much as Mexico talks about a shared problem. The costs of not getting control of it will be paid by the Mexicans."', 'qa': [{'question': 'What is the top concern among most Mexicans?', 'answers': ['security', 'military', 'drug killings']}, {'question': 'What did the police report?', 'answers': ['drug slaying.', 'reported the third consecutive day without a drug slaying.', 'third consecutive day without', 'the third consecutive day without a drug slaying.', 'slaying.']}, {'question': 'What are the questions that remain?', 'answers': ['whether increased military and police efforts in both nations can yield long-term results.', 'whether increased military and police efforts in both nations can yield', 'results.']}, {'question': 'What has been consistently shown to be a top concern?', 'answers': ['security is the', 'a major topic when U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits Mexico', 'security', 'The drug war and security will']}, {'question': 'What entity do Mexicans distrust?', 'answers': ['security', '"There\'s bad blood that exists between local communities and the military," said Birns.', 'military,"']}, {'question': 'For how many days was there no drug slaying?', 'answers': ['third consecutive', 'the third consecutive']}, {'question': 'What is a top concern for Mexicans?', 'answers': ['security']}, {'question': 'What did the police report was third straight day of?', 'answers': ['drug slaying.', 'without', 'consecutive', 'without a drug slaying.', 'reported']}]}
{'text': 'New York (CNN) -- When Alec Baldwin closed out the Academy Awards on Sunday night by slapping director Kathryn Bigelow squarely on the backside, that pretty much said it all.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was Ladies\' Night in a Boys\' Town.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, the opening routine by Baldwin and Steve Martin was very funny; there was sincerity and genuine gratitude from many of the winners; despite weird digressions into arcane areas like sound recording, the program moved briskly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut did the orchestra need to follow Bigelow\'s win of her long-deserved best director prize, for "The Hurt Locker," by playing the old Helen Reddy song "I Am Woman"?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Zoe Saldana and Carey Mulligan arrived on stage to present the Best Original Song award, did they have to be intro-ed with "Thank Heaven For Little Girls"?\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in addition to being groped by Baldwin, did Bigelow have to be so muscled-in-on by her fellow producers when she was picking up the best picture award for her film, "The Hurt Locker"?\n\n\n\n\n\n\'The Hurt Locker\' wins six Oscars\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe that wacky Elinor Burkett had a point: The producer of "Music by Prudence" -- which had just won the Oscar for best documentary short -- barreled on stage, saying "Let the woman speak!" and commandeering the mike from her director, Roger Ross Williams.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe provided a classic moment of Oscar craziness and the one instance of spontaneity in an evening when all the big favorites won all the big prizes. Burkett seemed boorish, sure. But that doesn\'t necessarily make her wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences certainly faced a dilemma this year: Vote for the future, or make up for the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nYears from now, it will probably look profoundly shortsighted that "Avatar," one of the biggest movies ever -- and, more importantly, the one that indicates where movies are going -- didn\'t win the top prize when Hollywood had a chance to bestow it.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, the Oscars gave their most coveted awards to a small indie film about an unpopular war and a director whose sex had never before been honored with a best director prize.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat helped make it all so complicated was not that there\'s been a long, long history of overlooked genius female directors that the Oscars had to atone for.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sin at stake was -- and is -- that women simply have never been given an equal chance to direct.\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictably, Bigelow didn\'t have to be as good as the boys, she had to be better. And she was.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut earning your Oscars and actually getting them are two different things. Fortunately for Bigelow, she had history on her side last night.\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Cameron didn\'t.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe billions being made by "Avatar" will probably be some consolation, but neither he nor his movie are warm and fuzzy, which is what the Academy voters like.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the big-hearted, sentimental acceptance by best actor Jeff Bridges ("Crazy Heart"), and the rather elegant, funny remarks by best actress Sandra Bullock ("The Blind Side"), are exactly what we all want Oscar night to be.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat, and a few good jokes, which is what Martin and Baldwin provided, arriving on stage after a musical extravaganza starring Neil Patrick Harris that seemed ready to recall the bad old days of producer Alan Carr and the notorious Rob Lowe/Snow White musical overture of 1989.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking back on Oscar\'s \'train wreck\'\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing so ghastly reared its ugly head last night, although there were a few moments of bad choices, bad manners and a strategy that was, at best, elusive.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all the changing characters and categories on Oscar-watchers\' betting pool ballots, there are certain things we bet on no matter what: one, that the show will be interminable; two, that it will last at least until midnight (ET) no matter how they try to contain it; and, three, that there will be moments in the show itself that, although planned by seemingly sane individuals, will be inexplicable, if not grotesque.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast night did not disappoint. While someone like poor Tivi Magnusson got drowned out by the orchestra (after he and Joachim Back won best live action short for "The New Tenants"), the show\'s producers thought it made perfect sense to devote relatively huge chunks of time to examining the niceties of animated short subjects or providing weary viewers the inevitable, unspeakable interpretive dance number, this one devoted to the evening\'s musical scores.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore painful, at least to this viewer\'s eyes, was an overlong salute to the late director John Hughes, featuring a reunion of some of his more famous players, a few of whom -- Molly Ringwald, for instance, and Judd Nelson -- looked positively shell shocked.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only surprises of the night were in the best foreign film category: The Argentine "El Secreto de Sus Ojos," beat out the favored "White Ribbon," thus continuing the Oscar tradition of giving the foreign-film prize to something few have even seen (a foreign-film Oscar doesn\'t do much good, one should remember, for a movie that\'s already opened and closed).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other surprise was the rudeness with which costume designer Sandy Powell accepted her "Young Victoria" Oscar.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I\'ve already got two of these," she said, before dissing her coworkers and, by extension, the Academy in toto.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrusque dismissal is not a quality Oscar tolerates very well and it\'s not likely Ms. Powell will be back, unlike Martin and Baldwin, who were the funniest Oscar hosts ever, proving there\'s power in numbers, the sum often can be more than the parts, and that it\'s always good to have an extra pair of hands, as long as they stay off Kathryn Bigelow\'s butt.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Anderson.', 'qa': [{'question': 'what was avatar nominated for', 'answers': ['Oscar', 'Academy']}, {'question': 'The critic said a salaute to which late director was long overdue', 'answers': ['John Hughes,']}, {'question': 'what did the critic say', 'answers': ["It was Ladies' Night in a Boys' Town."]}, {'question': 'Who is John Hughes?', 'answers': ['late director', 'director']}, {'question': 'Who were the funniest Oscar hosts, according to a critic?', 'answers': ['Martin and Baldwin,', 'Martin', 'Baldwin,']}, {'question': 'What has Oscar had to atone for?', 'answers': ['long history of overlooked genius female directors', 'long history of overlooked genius female directors that the', 'overlooked genius female directors']}, {'question': 'Which two people were said to be the funniest hosts ever', 'answers': ['Martin', 'Baldwin,']}, {'question': "John Anderson said the Oscar's had to atone for what", 'answers': ['overlooked genius female directors', 'long history of overlooked genius female directors']}]}

{'text': 'PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN) -- It was supposed to be just another day at work.\n\nJob losses suffered by Linda and Chris Metzger have had a ripple effect on other businesses in their community\n\nIn early March 2008, 31-year-old Linda Metzger went to the New York office where she had worked as an assistant vice president in the marketing department at Lehman Brothers for about a year. Only 15 minutes into her work day, Metzger was called into her manager\'s office, where a representative from human resources was waiting.\n\n"They told me that the company was having economic difficulties and that they had to make budget cuts," Metzger said. "They were afraid that they were going to have to let me go and that it was not due to performance."\n\nMetzger says that would be her last day at Lehman Brothers. She was given some time to collect her composure, gather her belongings and head home.\n\nShe was out of a $90,000-a-year job and was getting married in three months. Metzger says it was a chance for her and her fiancÃ© to refocus, relocate and start a new life.\n\nWithin a few weeks, they both found jobs near Phoenix, Arizona, earning close to what they were making in New York. They bought a home and two new cars and got married.\n\nBut the good feelings suddenly and dramatically ended in October when Metzger, who was four months pregnant, showed up to work at Lumension, where she was a marketing manager.\n\nMetzger says she was called into the office, and it happened again. She was laid off from her second job in less than a year.  Watch Linda talk about getting laid off Â»\n\n"I was so overwhelmed and so shocked that I just immediately burst into tears."\n\nShe thought about how she and her new husband, who had just moved across the country, were going to be able to afford their new life and all the bills that came with it.\n\nA week later, Chris Metzger was called into his manager\'s office at the job placement agency where he worked. He was told that because of the economy, his office was closing, and he was out of a job. Now he had to break the news to his wife.\n\n"I just came home, and she was upstairs," Chris Metzger said. He tried to find the best way to tell his wife that they no longer had an income. "I walked upstairs, I gave her a hug, and I said, \'I lost my job today.\' "\n\n"I immediately fell to the floor and just started crying," Linda said.\n\nWithin 10 days, Chris was able to find a new job, but Linda had no such luck. The economy was taking its toll, and very few companies were hiring. They looked at their budget and started to eliminate all the extras, including dining out and gym memberships. Vacations were put on hold; furniture purchases had to wait; fine meals out were now home-cooked meals.\n\nThe Metzgers\' story is playing out all across America as businesses and communities feel the ripple effect of the recession\n\n"When jobs get lost, demand falls for a whole bunch of businesses. You\'re not going to buy new shoes; you\'re going to put new soles on them," said Lakshman Achuthan, managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, an independent group that studies recessions.\n\nRestaurants where the Metzgers used to dine are now closed. The furniture store where they hoped to fill their home is having a liquidation sale and is closing in three weeks.\n\n"You\'ve pulled back from all your spending except paying your mortgage and putting food on the table," Achuthan said.\n\nIt\'s a sign of the times. A drive down the Phoenix streets and strip malls are filled with vacant office space .\n\nChris and Linda Metzger are expecting their first child in April.

{'text': 'Editor\'s note: Leslie Morgan Steiner is the author of "Crazy Love," a new memoir about domestic violence, and the anthology "Mommy Wars," which explores the polarization between stay-at-home and career moms.\n\nLeslie Morgan Steiner says domestic violence afflicts the well-to-do as well as the poor.\n\n(CNN) -- For two days, news reports called her "the 20-year old victim" allegedly attacked by R&B singer and dancer Chris Brown in his car early February 8 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nWe all now have good reason to believe that the alleged victim was pop singer Rihanna, Brown\'s girlfriend.\n\nThe story has dominated the general media with good reason. Both singers are young, apple-cheek gorgeous, immensely talented and squeaky clean -- the last couple you\'d imagine as domestic violence headliners.\n\nPerhaps the only good that will come from the Rihanna/Brown publicity is destruction of our culture\'s misconception that abusers and their victims can only be universally poor, uneducated and powerless.\n\nBrown, whose first song debuted at No. 1 and whose first album topped the Billboard Hot 100, appeared on a Disney sitcom and in Sesame Street, Got Milk? and Wrigley\'s Doublemint Gum commercials. Barbados-born Rihanna has been big-brothered by music industry legends like Jay-Z and Kanye West and is signed to the Def Jam Recordings label.\n\nShe has been astonishingly successful in the short time she has been on the music scene, attaining five Billboard Hot 100 No. 1\'s with "SOS," "Umbrella," "Take a Bow," "Disturbia" and T.I.\'s "Live Your Life."\n\nLike Rihanna, I had a bright future in my early 20s. I met my abusive lover at 22. I\'d just graduated from Harvard and had a job at Seventeen Magazine in New York.\n\nMy husband worked on Wall Street and was an Ivy League graduate as well. In our world, we were the last couple you\'d imagine enmeshed in domestic violence.\n\nMany of my ex-husband\'s attacks also took place in our car. For reasons I never understood, the enclosed, soundproof space brought out his worst violence. He punched me so fiercely that my face had bruises from his fist on one side and from hitting the window on the other.\n\nAs trapped in the car as I was in our marriage, it was there that I endured tirades about how controlling I was with money, how flirtatious and naïve I was with other men, how defiant and disrespectful I was of my husband\'s authority.\n\nSo, I suppose I have more understanding than most about the shame, fury, confusion and disappointment Rihanna may be experiencing. What\'s hardest for outsiders to fathom is how lethal a cocktail love, hope and sympathy can be. I first fell for my husband the night he confided how he, like Chris Brown, had been traumatized as a young boy by domestic violence in his home.\n\n"He used to hit my mom ... He made me terrified all the time, terrified like I had to pee on myself," Brown said during a 2007 interview with Giant magazine.\n\nBrown hasn\'t explained what happened in the recent incident, but this week he released a statement saying that he\'s sorry and saddened by it.\n\nOur culture encourages women to nurture men, making it predictable that many experience a seductive empathy for abusive men, as well as the misguided hope that love can obliterate an ugly past.\n\nIn my case, it took four years, myriad terrifying attacks, and the intervention of the police and family court before I understood how little I could help my ex get over his abusive childhood.\n\nI certainly felt alone during my abusive relationship, but unfortunately I was in good company. The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that between 1 million and 3 million women in America are physically abused by their husband or boyfriend each year.\n\nEvery day, on average, three women are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends. At some point in our lives, 25 percent of American women will report being physically abused or raped by intimate partners, according to the National Violence Against Women Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHowever, these statistics, grim as they are, fail to highlight the root of the abuse cycle. A national survey showed that 50 percent of men who frequently assault their wives also frequently abuse their children.\n\nWitnessing abuse, as Chris Brown and my ex-husband did as young boys, is a form of abuse itself. Tragically, many victims of childhood abuse grow up to be abusers themselves. I always sensed that my husband didn\'t want to be hurting me -- he knew exactly how excruciating love and fear felt mixed together -- but his childhood rage overpowered his adult sensibilities.\n\nA few months after I left my marriage, I happened across another couple in another car, late at night on an empty street. I slowed down as a well-dressed woman about 25 years old was walking away from a white Honda, brushing off a tall, handsome young man wearing a sports coat and jeans.\n\nSuddenly she turned and tried to run. He grabbed her with his long arms and shoved her up against a dirty storefront. Even from my car I could see the fear on her pretty face.\n\nWithout thinking, I jerked my car over and got out. By this time the man had let the woman go and she\'d slid behind the wheel of the car. He stepped back as I approached, his anger displaced by uncertainty and shame at being interrupted. I didn\'t look at him. I leaned into the car as she sat clutching the wheel, crying and staring straight ahead.\n\n"I just left a husband who beat me for three years," I said. "You do not have to put up with this. You do not deserve to be treated like this."\n\n"I know," she whispered as fresh tears poured down her face. She sniffed loudly and shook her head. She wouldn\'t look at me. Her eyes were rimmed red, but I could see resolve in them.\n\n"You\'re right," she said. "It\'s just taking me longer than I thought."\n\nAs I left, I gave the man a long stare.

{'text': '(EW.com) -- Although it didn\'t set a franchise record, "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 1" had one of the best openings in box-office history by debuting to $139.5 million, according to studio estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\'s the fifth-best opening weekend ever, behind "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2," "The Dark Knight," "Spider-Man 3," and "The Twilight Saga: New Moon," which held on to the franchise record.\n\n\n\n\n\n"New Moon" debuted to a slightly better $142.8 million on the same November weekend two years ago. What\'s interesting is how closely "Breaking Dawn" followed "New Moon\'s" trajectory. "New Moon" grossed $72.7 million its first day, and then dropped 42 percent on Saturday and 34 percent on Sunday. By comparison, "Breaking Dawn" earned $72 million on Friday (the third-best opening day ever), and then fell 44 percent on Saturday and a projected 34 percent today.\n\n\n\n\n\n"New Moon" ultimately finished its domestic run with $296.6 million, and it\'s too early to tell whether "Breaking Dawn" will wind up a bit short of that final figure. Even if it does, Summit Entertainment won\'t be complaining about grossing nearly $300 million from the fourth movie of its franchise. And, of course, the domestic box office is only a part of the equation here. "Breaking Dawn" took in $144 million from 54 foreign territories this week, pushing its worldwide debut to a staggering $283.5 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummit reports that "Breaking Dawn" attracted a crowd that was, unsurprisingly, 80 percent female. What is surprising is that the PG-13 movie\'s audience wasn\'t as young as you\'d think, with 60 percent over the age of 21. According to CinemaScore, 30 percent of the film\'s audience was under 18, but an even larger 42 percent was between the ages of 18 and 34. The popular conception is that The "Twilight Saga" is merely a teenage phenomenon, but these figures seem to prove otherwise. The $110 million movie received a good-but-not-great B+ rating from CinemaScore graders.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn second place was Warner Bros.\' 3-D animated sequel "Happy Feet Two," which fell far short of expectations by dancing to only $22 million. The 2006 original, an Oscar winner for best animated feature, opened to $41.5 million -- and that was without the benefit of 3-D surcharges.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Happy Feet Two" was saddled with mediocre reviews, which might have discouraged some parents. Furthermore, five years could have been too long of a wait, especially for a sequel that appeared very similar to its predecessor. The original "Happy Feet" was released a year after March of the Penguins, when the Antarctic birds were having a moment in the cultural zeitgeist. That moment has clearly passed. The $135 million sequel earned a B+ rating from CinemaScore moviegoers, and 3-D theaters accounted for 50 percent of its weekend tally.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of the top five consisted of holdovers. The 3-D action flick "Immortals" dropped a harsh 62 percent for $12.3 million -- a second-weekend decline that was larger than both "300" (54 percent) and "Clash of the Titans" (57 percent). "Jack and Jill" witnessed a typical Adam Sandler fall of 52 percent for $12 million. And even though "Happy Feet Two" underperformed, "Puss in Boots" lost much of its family audience. The animated adventure dropped 57 percent for $10.7 million in its fourth weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn limited release, Alexander Payne\'s "The Descendants," starring George Clooney, debuted to $1.2 million from 29 theaters -- enough for a tenth-place finish. The Oscar hopeful raked in an impressive $42,150 per location. Only "Midnight in Paris," "The Tree of Life," and "Jane Eyre" opened to stronger per-theater averages this year, and those movies started out on far fewer screens than "The Descendants."\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

{'text': 'TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- A former Iranian presidential candidate is calling on one of the Islamic republic\'s most powerful clerics to approve a special committee to investigate alleged mistreatment of detainees arrested in the aftermath of the disputed presidential elections.\n\n\n\nMehdi Karrubi says an "impartial committee" is needed to investigate alleged mistreatment of detainees.\n\n\n\nIn an open letter to Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani posted Saturday on his party\'s Web site, reformist Mehdi Karrubi says an "impartial committee" is needed to "investigate these tragedies with transparency until they are resolved." He said he is willing to lead the investigation in a "truthful, unbiased fashion."\n\n\n\nThe letter is dated July 29 and was posted on the Karrubi\'s Eetemade-Melli (National Trust) party\'s Web site, called Saham News. The Web site said the letter was posted after Rafsanjani failed to respond.\n\n\n\nThe treatment of detainees at Iran\'s prisons has increasingly become a high profile issue, with human-rights groups accusing guards of conducting harsh interrogations, beatings, sleep deprivation, and threats of torture to coerce false confessions.\n\n\n\nIranian media reported that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\'s supreme leader, ordered one prison, Kahrizak, shut down amid reports it did not measure up to the required standards. Kahrizak\'s chief was fired and arrested over allegations of detainee mistreatment, according to local reports Saturday.\n\n\n\nA special parliamentary committee has made rounds at Tehran\'s Evin prison, but did not find any signs of abuse, according to recent media reports. Hundreds of detainees have since been reportedly released from Evin, though "political figures" were held and put on trial.\n\n\n\nIn his plea for an investigation, Karrubi says he has heard descriptions of torture and violence that make his "body shake," though he doesn\'t specify a prison.\n\n\n\n"Some of the former detainees have told of such brutal and violent, repeated rapes of the young women [in detention] that have caused irreparable damage to their reproductive systems," Karrubi says in the letter. "Others have raped our detained young men with such brutality that they [the victims] have been afflicted by depression and are no longer speaking with anyone and refuse to leave the dark corners of their houses."\n\n\n\nHe adds that an investigation will "teach a lesson to the thugs and criminals in the future and prevent the smearing of the reputation of the Islamic Republic."\n\n\n\nRafsanjani -- a former president and head of the Assembly of Experts, the council responsible for appointing or removing the supreme leader -- called for the release of the detainees during a highly anticipated July 17 sermon at Friday prayers.\n\n\n\nHe backed Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi in the presidential election, in which hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming winner. Karrubi and Moussavi unsuccessfully challenged the results for weeks, and Ahmadinejad was sworn in for his second term last week.\n\n\n\nRafsanjani himself has been accused of helping fuel the post-election unrest as part of recent mass trials of the remaining detainees over the past week.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What does Karrubi claim happened to both men and women?', 'answers': ['brutal', 'mistreatment', 'rapes', 'violent, repeated rapes']}, {'question': 'In what elction was Mehdi Karrubi a candidate?', 'answers': ['Iranian', 'presidential election,', 'former Iranian presidential']}, {'question': 'Who called for investigation into the letter?', 'answers': ['Mehdi Karrubi']}, {'question': 'What is he willing to do?', 'answers': ['lead the investigation in a "truthful, unbiased fashion."']}, {'question': 'What was called for by him?', 'answers': ['most powerful clerics to approve a special committee to investigate alleged mistreatment of detainees arrested in the aftermath', 'former', 'the release of the detainees during a highly anticipated July 17 sermon at Friday prayers.', 'presidential elections.', 'of the disputed', 'A', "Iranian presidential candidate is calling on one of the Islamic republic's"]}, {'question': 'What is Karrubi looking to investigate?', 'answers': ['alleged mistreatment of detainees.', 'mistreatment of detainees.', 'alleged mistreatment of detainees arrested in the aftermath of the disputed presidential elections.']}, {'question': "What are some of the claims he's making?", 'answers': ['detainee mistreatment,', 'alleged mistreatment of detainees arrested in the aftermath of the disputed presidential elections.']}, {'question': 'What was he a candidate for?', 'answers': ['Iranian presidential', 'approve a special committee to investigate alleged mistreatment of detainees']}]}

Multiple witnesses and medics said dozens were killed in a violent government crackdown that started on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nProtesters have used Change Square for a seven-month sit-in demanding the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. He is recuperating in Saudi Arabia from a attack in June on his palace but has vowed to return to Yemen to finish his term.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach wounded protester was carried by six or seven others -- sometimes friends of the casualty -- and taken to the medical camp in the square. Drops of blood created trails on the ground tracing the long, bloody route to a field hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the medical camp, hundreds of young people were covered in blood and screaming from pain.

{'text': '(CNN) -- U.S. Air Force officials called off their response late Friday afternoon at a Tucson, Arizona, base after reports that an armed man had entered an office building, the U.S. military branch said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier in the day, a U.S. military official told CNN that a gunman was believed to be holed up in a building at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis precipitated the Air Force to call for a lock-down -- which began at 10:30 a.m. -- "following the unconfirmed sighting of" such a man.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo shots were ever fired and law enforcement teams are on site, said the official, who had direct knowledge of the situation from conversations with base officials but did not want to be identified.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, at 6 p.m., Col. John Cherrey -- who commands the Air Force\'s 355th Fighter Wing -- told reporters that no gunman or weapon was ever found. He added that the building, where the gunman was once thought to have entered, has been secured after authorities went through it room-by-room.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement came about two hours after the Air Force stated that its officials had "terminated" their response to the incident. All base personnel were leaving via a "controlled release."\n\n\n\n\n\n"With the help of the Tucson emergency services communities, Airmen were successful in maintaining the safety and security of the Desert Lightning Team," the Air Force said, alluding to the name used for Air Force personnel based in the arid southern Arizona locale.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, Tucson Police Sgt.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Chinese language media often refer to Jay Chou as the "small heavenly king," but the Taiwan born pop idol is more down-to-earth than the many accolades he receives suggest.\n\n\n\nAt 29, Jay Chou is already a household name in many Asian countries.\n\n\n\n"I think I tend to believe in myself.

That\'s why I would never write anything about suicide or whatever, because I think we all need the courage to deal with our lives," he said.\n\n\n\nChou was brought up by his mother, a school teacher in Linkou in Taiwan. His parents divorced while he was at a young age.\n\n\n\nHe began playing the piano as a 3-year-old, continuing to practice daily throughout his school days where despite being a diligent pupil he was academically average.\n\n\n\nWhile a so-so student he developed a way to express himself by focusing on playing the piano, and from it developed a self-reliant streak.\n\n\n\n"I think my confidence belongs to the stage or when I\'m standing in front of the screen. I\'m like two different people on-stage and off-stage," he told CNN\'s Talk Asia.\n\n\n\nChou\'s career was given a boost when he was spotted by Taiwanese entertainer Jacky Wu while backstage before a TV talent contest.

{'text': 'LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Natasha Richardson, the Tony Award-winning stage actress and member of the famed Redgrave acting clan, died Wednesday from injuries suffered in a ski accident. She was 45.\n\nComedian Joan Rivers says actress Natasha Richardson had "such a family."\n\nOn Wednesday night\'s "Larry King Live," comedian Joan Rivers remembered Richardson for her marriage to actor Liam Neeson and used her sharp wit to recall her own skiing experience.\n\nThe following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\nLarry King: You knew Natasha Richardson. What was your reaction?\n\nJoan Rivers: Oh, [it] shouldn\'t have happened. We were more acquaintances than friends. But we spent one amazing day on a boat with my whole family and she and Liam and the boys. And they were such a family.\n\nKing: What was the occasion?\n\nRivers: We were all in the Caribbean, and we all kind of knew each other from dinner parties and so forth. And we met at the airport, and we said, "Oh, let\'s get together, with the kids." And it was one of those wonderful days. We laughed and talked and had lunch, and the kids were jumping off the boat and we were drinking wine. She was just amazing and darling.\n\nKing: Have you seen her work on Broadway?\n\nRivers: I\'ve seen her work. I love actresses who go back and forth. I always have such great respect for someone who goes to Broadway and then film and goes back again. I saw her in "The Philadelphia Story" years ago in London when she won an award. She was very young in a musical version of that.\n\nKing: What was your read on them as a couple that day?\n\nRivers: Totally happy, totally devoted to each other. That\'s what kills me. I mean [it] just shouldn\'t have happened. ... And they made such a good-looking couple, too. He doted on what she said, she doted on -- it was just perfect.\n\nKing: How did you learn of this yesterday?\n\nRivers: One of our mutual friends called me and said, do you know about -- I just saw them recently in the thing that Prince Charles gave in England, and a mutual friend said, did you heard about what happened to Natasha? I said, what are you talking about? And he said, she\'s brain-dead.  Watch King talk to celebrities about Richardson »\n\nKing: So you knew yesterday?\n\nRivers: I knew yesterday. And I knew yesterday that she was brain-dead. And I was told, which is, again, so dear, that they kept her alive purposely to bring her back to New York, so that the boys could say goodbye to her before --\n\nKing: Really?\n\nRivers: Yes.\n\nKing: That\'s both beautiful and sad.\n\nRivers: Look at this, it gets me crazy. It\'s sad.\n\nKing: Do you ski?\n\nRivers: I had a terrible fall about 12 years ago. And I lay there in the snow and I said to myself, "If I get up, I\'m not coming back and I got up."\n\nKing: You\'re like, "Goodbye."\n\nRivers: Goodbye. And I swear to you, I laid on the ground and I go, "If everything works, that\'s it. That\'s it."\n\nKing: You\'ve heard the doctor. What do you make of this? There must have been something previously. It was a slight fall?\n\nRivers: You don\'t know; you hit your head wrong. You walk out of your house and it\'s over.

{'text': '(CNN) -- German car manufacturer BMW has announced it is to pull out of Formula One at the end of the current season after a "landmark" decision to restructure the group\'s motorsport activities was made by the company\'s board in a meeting on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nBMW Sauber have opted to pull out Formula One at the end of the 2009 season.\n\n\n\nA statement on the BMW Sauber F1 Team\'s official Web site stated that "the Formula One campaign is [no longer] a key promoter for us" and that "current developments in motor sport" had resulted in the decision.\n\n\n\nDr Norbert Reithofer, chairman of the BMW board of management, said: "Of course, this was a very difficult decision for us. But it\'s a resolute step in view of our company\'s strategic realignment."\n\n\n\nThe team currently lie eighth in the constructors\' world championship with eight points after 10 rounds and of their two drivers -- Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld -- Heidfeld sits a lowly 13th in the drivers\' championship with just six points.\n\n\n\nBMW are the second manufacturer to pull out of F1 in a further blow to the sport after Honda\'s withdrawal before the start of the 2009 season.  CNN\'s analysis of BMW\'s exit from Formula One. »\n\n\n\nHowever, since Wednesday\'s announcement, rival German car manufacturer Mercedes have reconfirmed their commitment to the sport.\n\n\n\n"We regret the withdrawal of BMW from Formula One. This decision will not have the slightest influence on our commitment to Formula One," a spokesman for the company told AFP.\n\n\n\nMotorsport\'s world governing body, the FIA, reiterated their belief that the move was an indication of how the global economic downturn was affecting the sport.\n\n\n\nIn a statement on their official Web site, they said: "The FIA regrets the announcement of BMW\'s intended withdrawal from Formula One but is not surprised by it. It has been clear for some time that motor sport cannot ignore the world economic crisis.\n\n\n\n"Car manufacturers cannot be expected to continue to pour large sums of money into Formula One when their survival depends on redundancies, plant closures and the support of the taxpayer. This is why the FIA prepared regulations to reduce costs drastically.\n\n\n\n"These measures were needed to alleviate the pressure on manufacturers following Honda\'s withdrawal but also to make it possible for new teams to enter. Had these regulations not been so strongly opposed by a number of team principals, the withdrawal of BMW and further such announcements in the future might have been avoided," the statement added.\n\n\n\nBMW entered Formula One with a takeover of the Sauber F1 team in 2005 and finished fifth in the constructors\' championship in their debut campaign, before racing under their own name in 2006.\n\n\n\nWith an aggressive aim of winning the world championship within three years, the team came close in 2007 finishing second to Ferrari, thanks largely to the exclusion of McLaren-Mercedes from the manufacturer\'s points standings. In 2008, the team captured third, thanks in part to a first win in the Canadian Grand Prix for Polish driver Kubica.\n\n\n\nThe statement continued: "It only took us three years to establish ourselves as a top team with the BMW Sauber F1 team. Unfortunately, the team were unable to meet expectations in the current season."\n\n\n\nThe car-builder was also unable to "quantify redundancies" that may come from the move which follows the exit of  Honda in December.\n\n\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer -- who according to FIA president Max Mosley were spending $500m a season to compete in the sport -- cited the "sudden contraction of the world economies" as their reason to end racing.\n\n\n\nThis led to Mosley spearheading an FIA plan to enforce controversial cost-cutting measures on the teams for the 2010 season. The Formula One furor explained.\n\n\n\nThese measures, which split opinion within the sport, are expected to be adopted in a watered-down form and could eventually save $60 million from the cost of running a team, according to Mosley.\n\n\n\nHowever, the FIA were prompted by BMW\'s exit to warn again that if the measures were weakened too much the positive impact on the sport could be reduced.\n\n\n\n"As a result of a sustained cost-cutting campaign by the FIA, new measures are in the process of being agreed which should make it easier for new teams to enter and enable existing ones to participate on much reduced budgets.\n\n\n\n"It is no secret that these measures do not go as far as the FIA would have liked but a compromise was needed in the interests of harmony in the sport. Hopefully it will be enough to prevent further withdrawals and provide a solid foundation for Formula One," the statement read.', 'qa': [{'question': 'In what year did BMW enter the sport?', 'answers': ['2005', '2006.']}, {'question': 'What reason does BMW give for leaving?', 'answers': ['"the Formula One campaign is [no longer] a key promoter', 'us"']}, {'question': 'what did BMW announce?', 'answers': ['it is to pull out of Formula One at the end of the', 'pull out of Formula One at the end of the', 'current', 'current season']}, {'question': 'When did BMW enter Formula One?', 'answers': ['2005', '2006.', 'in 2005', 'entered']}, {'question': 'What does BMW announce?', 'answers': ['Sauber have opted to pull out Formula One', 'has announced it is to pull out of Formula One', 'it is to pull out of Formula One at the end of the', 'pull out of Formula One', 'current season']}, {'question': 'What is the current position of the F1 team?', 'answers': ['key promoter for us"', 'Formula One campaign is [no longer]', 'company\'s strategic realignment."', '"current developments in motor sport"']}, {'question': 'When is BMW leaving Formula One', 'answers': ['the end of the', 'at the end of the', 'at the end of the 2009 season.', 'current season']}, {'question': 'what is the current porpuse of German motor manufacturer?', 'answers': ['decision', "restructure the group's motorsport activities", 'season', 'pull out of Formula One at the end of the']}]}

{'text': 'LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson\'s family and about 200 of their closest friends gathered on a hill Thursday evening for their final farewell to the pop singer, who died 10 weeks ago.\n\n\n\nThursday\'s service for singer Michael Jackson began 90 minutes past the announced start time.\n\n\n\nJackson\'s burial may lay to rest some of the mystery and controversy that erupted with his sudden death on June 25.\n\n\n\nHis large family was divided over where the superstar\'s final resting place should be, but matriarch Katherine Jackson settled on a crypt inside the well-guarded and ornate Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, California.\n\n\n\nThursday\'s service began 90 minutes past the announced start time, leaving dozens of celebrities -- including Elizabeth Taylor -- waiting in their seats for the 26 cars carrying the Jackson clan to arrive.  Gallery: Invitation for Jackson\'s service »\n\n\n\nIt began with Jackson\'s five brothers -- each wearing a single sequined glove -- carrying his flower-covered bronze casket onto the outdoor stage among six large bouquets of white lilies and white roses, along with green topiaries.\n\n\n\nHis three children, led by daughter, Paris, 11, placed a crown atop their father\'s coffin, which a family spokesman said it was "to signify the final resting place of the King of Pop."\n\n\n\nJackson\'s children, parents and siblings took their seats in the front row, while his nieces and nephews filled several rows of white chairs behind them.\n\n\n\nAfter an opening prayer by Pastor Lucius Smith, soul music legend Gladys Knight sang the gospel hymn "His Eye Is on the Sparrow."\n\n\n\nClifton Davis sang "Never Can Say Goodbye," a hit he wrote for The Jackson 5 -- the group that featured a young Michael and his brothers.\n\n\n\nWhat was said by Jackson\'s father, Joe Jackson, and others who took the lectern is not publicly known, because the family barred news cameras from the ceremony. A family statement issued afterward said close friends and family, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, spoke "spontaneously to celebrate Michael\'s life."\n\n\n\nNews helicopters hovering above captured video from a distance, but without sound.  Watch media cover Jackson funeral »\n\n\n\nLisa Marie Presley, one of Jackson\'s former wives and the daughter of Elvis, attended the service, according to the family statement. It did not mention Debbie Rowe, Jackson\'s second wife and the mother of his two oldest children.\n\n\n\nMacaulay Culkin, the "Home Alone" actor who spent time with Jackson during his Neverland Ranch days, was there with his girlfriend, actress Mila Kunis.\n\n\n\nActors Corey Feldman and Chris Tucker were also seen arriving for the service.\n\n\n\nMotown founder Berry Gordy, who gave Jackson and his brothers their first big record deal, and Quincy Jones, who produced Jackson\'s "Thriller" album, were there. Music producer Teddy Riley, who helped with Jackson\'s 1991 "Dangerous" album, attended.\n\n\n\nThe guest list included TV executive Suzanne de Passe, who produced a miniseries about Jackson\'s family, and Kenny Ortega,  who was producing Jackson\'s comeback show.\n\n\n\nThomas Mesereau, the lawyer who successfully defended Jackson in a child molestation trial, sat just behind the Jackson family.\n\n\n\nWhen the hour-long service ended, his brothers lifted Jackson\'s casket for a final time to carry him inside the Great Mausoleum, where he was placed in his crypt at 9:43 p.m. PT (12:43 a.m. ET Friday).\n\n\n\nThe family statement said it was "his final resting place."\n\n\n\nThe family and friends then drove to an Italian restaurant eight miles away, in Pasadena, California, for "a time of celebration."\n\n\n\nThe massive mausoleum, the final resting place for Clark Gable, Carole Lombard and dozens of other celebrities, is normally open to tourists, though the public is denied close access to crypts. Security guards, aided by cameras, keep constant vigil over the graves and crypts, which are surrounded by a world-class collection of art and architecture.\n\n\n\nThe Forest Lawn Web site boasts that the mausoleum, which draws its architectural inspiration from the Campo Santo in Italy, "has been called the \'New World\'s Westminster Abbey\' by Time Magazine."\n\n\n\nVisitors will see "exact replicas of Michelangelo\'s greatest works such as David, Moses, and La Pieta" and "Leonardo da Vinci\'s immortal Last Supper re-created in brilliant stained glass; two of the world\'s largest paintings," the Web site says.\n\n\n\nJackson\'s burial was delayed by division among family members, though Katherine Jackson would make the final decision, brother Jermaine Jackson recently told CNN.\n\n\n\nHe preferred to see his youngest brother laid to rest at his former Neverland Ranch home, north of Los Angeles in Santa Barbara County, California.\n\n\n\nThat idea was complicated by neighbors who vowed to oppose allowing a grave in the rural area -- and by Jackson family members who said the singer would not want to return to the home where he faced child molestation charges, of which he was ultimately acquitted.\n\n\n\nThe mystery of where Jackson would be buried became a media obsession in the weeks after his death.\n\n\n\nAfter his body was loaded onto a helicopter at UCLA\'s Ronald Reagan Medical Center hours after his June 25 death, it stayed in the custody of the Los Angeles County coroner for an autopsy.\n\n\n\nIt was only later disclosed that Jackson\'s corpse was kept in a refrigerated room at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn cemetery until his casket was carried by motorcade to downtown Los Angeles for a public memorial service in the Staples Center arena.\n\n\n\nAgain, speculation about Jackson\'s whereabouts grew when the media lost track of his casket after his brothers carried it out of sight inside the arena. It was only recently confirmed that it was taken back to the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn while awaiting his family\'s decision.\n\n\n\nThough Thursday\'s interment may settle one Jackson mystery, a more serious one remains. The coroner announced last week that he had ruled Jackson\'s death a homicide. A summary of the coroner\'s report said the anesthetic propofol and the sedative lorazepam were the primary drugs responsible for the singer\'s death.\n\n\n\nLos Angeles police detectives have not concluded their criminal investigation and no one has been charged.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What famous guests were there?', 'answers': ['Kenny Ortega,', 'Quincy Jones,', 'Teddy Riley,', 'Clifton Davis', 'Actors Corey Feldman and Chris Tucker', 'Lisa Marie Presley,', 'Thomas Mesereau,', 'Berry Gordy,', 'Macaulay Culkin,', 'list included', 'Pastor Lucius Smith,', 'Mila Kunis.', 'Suzanne de Passe,', "Michael Jackson's family", 'Gladys Knight']}, {'question': 'Who sang Never Can Say Goodbye?', 'answers': ['Clifton Davis']}, {'question': 'what other important guest were included at the funeral?', 'answers': ['Suzanne de Passe,', 'Kenny Ortega,', 'TV executive Suzanne de Passe,']}, {'question': 'Who were amongst the guests?', 'answers': ['Teddy Riley,', 'Clifton Davis', 'Berry Gordy,', 'Mila Kunis.', 'siblings', 'including Elizabeth Taylor', 'Kenny Ortega,', 'Gladys Knight', 'Quincy Jones,', 'Chris Tucker', "Jackson's children, parents", 'Pastor Lucius Smith,', 'TV executive Suzanne de Passe,', 'Suzanne de Passe,', 'Elizabeth Taylor', 'Macaulay Culkin,', 'Corey Feldman', 'Rev.

E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (Steven Spielberg, 1982) Spielberg\'s magic captures a perfect moment in childhood. We laughed and wept as his ugly little critter from outer space stole our hearts, while the kids fell firmly on the cute side of annoying. And oh, the music...\n\n\n\n2. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (Mel Stuart, 1971) Gene Wilder\'s whacked-out Willy Wonka adds a pinch of sinister to Roald Dahl\'s anarchic sweet treat, while the ignoble exits of Veruca Salt, Augustus Gloop and Mike Teevee were delicious.\n\n\n\n3. Babe (Chris Noonan, 1995) "That\'ll do, pig." Babe is wide-eyed with wonder in Dick King-Smith\'s touching tale of a lonely little sheep-pig. Comic relief from the ewes, subtle special effects and a heartwarming turn from James Cromwell as Farmer Hoggett make this a magical tale for all.\n\n\n\n4. Bugsy Malone (Alan Parker, 1976) Jodie Foster and Scott Baio (Yes, Chachi from "Happy Days!") star in this glorious escapade set in a musical world of pint-sized gangsters and mini-molls. Al Capone for the kids; just watch out for the splurge guns...\n\n\n\n5. Oliver! (Carol Reed, 1968) Jack Wild is delightful as the Artful Dodger, Ron Moody\'s devilish Fagin glints with avaricious greed and Shani Willis shines as poor, ill-fated Nancy. But it\'s Oliver Reed\'s dark and sinister Bill Sykes who stayed with us -- and left us wanting more.\n\n\n\n6.

All that, and a skateboarding Michael J. Fox? Mr Zemeckis, you spoil us!\n\n\n\n7. Home Alone (Chris Columbus, 1990) Macaulay Culkin\'s abandoned little boy sees off bungling burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern with a series of eye-watering stunts. It proves just how great a child actor Culkin was; pity the unpopular babysitters who became the victims of copycat pranksters...\n\n\n\n8. Ghostbusters (Ivan Reitman, 1984) Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis blast ghostly green monsters to oblivion in this slime-filled romp around NYC, while taking time out to annoy Sigourney Weaver en route. Who you gonna call?\n\n\n\n9. The Muppet Movie (James Frawley, 1979) Kermit and Co.\'s roadtrip to Hollywood is a fabulously fuzzy tale of friendship and following your dreams, but the Muppet Movie\'s not just for kids: there\'s cameos a-plenty (Bob Hope, Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, ORSON WELLES!) for Dad and smart one-liners by the bucketful for Mom.\n\n\n\n10. Harry Potter (Various, 2001-present) The Hogwarts trio\'s wizarding adventures, backed by a cast plump with the best of British actors. Fast-paced plots, spellbinding special effects and magical sets, but be warned: it\'ll have the li\'l critters pestering you to go to boarding school...\n\n\n\nAnd our favorite hide-behind-the-sofa moments...\n\n\n\nThe Wizard of Oz (Victor Fleming, 1939) "I\'ll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!"

The only film character to give the Wicked Witch of the West a run for her money.\n\n\n\nStar Wars (George Lucas, 1977) Darth Vader may cast a formidable shadow, but it\'s the sound of his labored breathing that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up -- as it gets closer, closer, closer...\n\n\n\nGhostbusters (Ivan Reitman, 1984) Rule 475 of Surviving the Movies: Never go into the basement! The thick silence in New York\'s Central Library masks a phantom infestation -- and they\'re not going quietly.

{'text': 'COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN)  -- Democratic Sen. Barack Obama kicked off a series of local outreach gospel concerts Friday in Charleston, South Carolina, that unexpectedly came back to bite his campaign.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama is competing for the black vote with Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe concerts were meant to boost black voters\' support for his presidential nominee bid -- the kind of events that would normally fly under the national radar.\n\nThe ensuing controversy highlighted that Obama\'s desire to unite disparate voting blocs -- especially religious voters -- under his umbrella of "change" is not without some serious pitfalls.\n\nWhen the campaign announced the lineups for the three-city "Embrace the Change!" gospel tour last week, one name stood out to gay bloggers: Donnie McClurkin.\n\nThe Grammy-award winning singer is on record as saying homosexuality is a choice, and that he was "once involved with those desires and those thoughts" but was able to get past them through prayer.\n\nTo say the least, neither of those arguments is very popular in the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.\n\nJohn Aravosis, a prominent gay blogger and co-founder of the Web site AmericaBlog, led the charge against the Obama campaign, writing that the Illinois Democrat was "sucking up to anti-gay bigots" and "giving them a stage."\n\nWhen the story bubbled up into the mainstream media, it took the Obama campaign by surprise.\n\nObama\'s efforts in the Palmetto State have overwhelmingly targeted African-American churchgoers in a bid to win over black voters in South Carolina from rival Sen. Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe campaign has vigorously promoted the candidate\'s faith, launching "40 Days of Faith and Family" in September, which used Bible study groups to tap into the black electorate.\n\nCampaigners have run three radio ads, one of which called Obama a "Christian family man," that aired on gospel stations across the state.\n\nEarlier this month, Obama spoke at an evangelical church in the traditionally conservative city of Greenville, where he demonstrated a casual familiarity with Christian vocabulary, telling the crowd, to much applause, that "I am confident that we can create a kingdom right here on Earth."\n\nAfter that appearance, the Obama campaign told CNN that Republicans no longer had a choke hold on issues of faith and values.\n\n"I think that what you\'re seeing is a breaking down of the sharp divisions that existed maybe during the \'90s," Obama said. "At least in politics, the perception was that the Democrats were fearful of talking about faith, and on the other hand you had the Republicans who had a particular brand of faith that oftentimes seemed intolerant or pushed people away."\n\nBut on Tuesday, Obama was forced to confront the uncomfortable truth that some Christians and gays are a little more than just strange bedfellows, especially among blacks.\n\nObama issued a statement saying, "I strongly disagree with Reverend [Donnie] McClurkin\'s views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the United States," and argued that it is important to confront homophobia among religious African Americans.\n\nA September poll of African Americans in South Carolina by Winthrop University and ETV showed that 62 percent of those surveyed said that "sex between two adults of the same sex" is "strongly unacceptable."\n\nObama held a conference call Wednesday with Joe Solomonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, and announced that the Rev. Andy Sidden, an openly gay South Carolina pastor, will appear at the same event as McClurkin on Sunday in Columbia.\n\nSolomonese was not completely assuaged.\n\n"I spoke with Senator Barack Obama today and expressed to him our community\'s disappointment for his decision to continue to remain associated with Reverend McClurkin, an anti-gay preacher who states the need to \'break the curse of homosexuality,\'" he said in a statement.\n\n"There is no gospel in Donnie McClurkin\'s message for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people and their allies. That\'s a message that certainly doesn\'t belong on any presidential candidate\'s stage."\n\nThe State newspaper in Columbia reported Friday that Obama organized a conference call Thursday night with gay and lesbian leaders. After the call, the South Carolina Gay and Lesbian Pride Movement announced it will hold a protest vigil outside Sunday\'s concert in Columbia.\n\nPrivately, Obama aides say they believe Obama is a candidate of real, transformational change, and that uproars like the McClurkin controversy are necessary speed bumps on the road to bringing people with opposing viewpoints together to air their differences.\n\nWill Obama\'s refusal to kick McClurkin off the concert bill hurt him? Like many political squabbles, despite the national story, it depends how much the controversy resonates with voters in those crucial early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nAnd in South Carolina, where African Americans make up about half of Democratic primary-goers, voters might not have a problem with McClurkin at all.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama defended his patriotism Monday, telling a crowd in Independence, Missouri, that his "deep and abiding love for this country" is the reason he is running for president.\n\n\n\nSen. Barack Obama\'s speech on patriotism comes days before the Fourth of July.\n\n\n\n"At certain times over the last 16 months, I have found, for the first time, my patriotism challenged -- at times as a result of my own carelessness, more often as a result of the desire by some to score political points and raise fears and doubts about who I am and what I stand for," he said in President Harry Truman\'s hometown, just days before the Fourth of July.\n\n\n\nObama vowed to never question the patriotism of others in the campaign, adding "I will not stand idly by when I hear others question mine."\n\n\n\nObama has been defending his patriotism ever since the beginning of the primary season, when he was first criticized for not wearing a flag pin -- which he now does much more frequently -- and when false rumors began circulating that he did not say the Pledge of Allegiance.  Watch excerpts of Obama\'s speech »\n\n\n\nA widely distributed photo also seemed to show him failing to place his hand over his heart during a rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner."\n\n\n\nObama\'s wife, Michelle, also was criticized about her patriotism, after telling an audience at a campaign event, "For the first time in my adult lifetime, I\'m really proud of my country."\n\n\n\nObama\'s campaign said she was just excited about the campaign\'s grassroots support, but her words still provided fodder for her husband\'s opponents.\n\n\n\nAt his appearance Monday, Barack Obama appealed to unity. "Given the enormous challenges that lie before us, we can no longer afford these sorts of divisions," he said. "None of us expect that arguments about patriotism will, or should, vanish entirely; after all, when we argue about patriotism, we are arguing about who we are as a country, and more importantly, who we should be.\n\n\n\n"But surely, we can agree that no party or political philosophy has a monopoly on patriotism. And surely, we can arrive at a definition of patriotism that, however rough and imperfect, captures the best of America\'s common spirit."\n\n\n\nObama said that for him, "patriotism starts as a gut instinct, a loyalty and love for country that\'s rooted in some of my earliest memories."\n\n\n\nObama described how as he grew up, his patriotism matured to something that "would survive my growing awareness of our nation\'s imperfections: its ongoing racial strife; the perversion of our political system that were laid bare during the Watergate hearings; the wrenching poverty of the Mississippi Delta and the hills of Appalachia."\n\n\n\nObama said he learned that "what makes America great has never been its perfection, but the belief that it can be made better."\n\n\n\nPatriotism, he said, must involve the willingness to sacrifice. He called attention to the service of John McCain, the presumptive Republican candidate.\n\n\n\nMcCain\'s campaign has been calling on Obama to condemn comments from retired Gen. Wesley Clark, who said this weekend that McCain\'s service in Vietnam did not necessarily mean that he was qualified to serve as commander-in-chief. Read about what Clark said\n\n\n\nClark is a military adviser for Obama.\n\n\n\nIn his speech Monday, Obama did not directly address Clark\'s comments, but after calling attention to McCain\'s service, he said "no one should ever devalue that service, especially for the sake of a political campaign, and that goes for supporters of both sides."\n\n\n\n"We must always express our profound gratitude for the service of our men and women in uniform. Period," he said.\n\n\n\nJust as Obama was finishing his speech, his campaign released a statement about Clark\'s remarks.\n\n\n\n"As he\'s said many times before, Sen. Obama honors and respects Sen. McCain\'s service, and of course he rejects yesterday\'s statement by Gen.

This year it dried up early, on August 1, and hasn\'t revived, leaving the town\'s 145 residents high and dry and relying on water trucked in from the next state.\n\nEvery day at 6 p.m., Orme Mayor Tony Reames turns a big valve to release water from the town\'s tank.

{'text': 'Editor\'s note: Campbell Brown anchors CNN\'s "Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull" at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays. She delivered this commentary during the "Cutting through the Bull" segment of Tuesday night\'s broadcast.\n\nCNN\'s Campbell Brown says "having no life" isn\'t a requirement for a man to get a job.\n\n(CNN) -- How many times have politicians been warned about the dangers of an open microphone? And yet, on Tuesday, the lectern mic at the National Governors Conference picked up this little nugget from Pennsylvania\'s Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell.\n\nHe\'s having a conversation near the lectern about President-elect Barack Obama\'s choice for to lead the Homeland Security Department, Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano. Here is what Rendell said about Napolitano:\n\nRendell: Janet\'s perfect for that job. Because for that job, you have to have no life. Janet has no family. Perfect. She can devote, literally, 19-20 hours a day to it\n\nWow. Now, I\'m sure Gov. Napolitano has many qualifications for the job beyond having no family, and therefore the ability to devote 20 hours a day to the job.  Watch Campbell Brown\'s commentary Â»\n\nBut it is fascinating to me that that is the quality being highlighted here as so perfect. C\'mon. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff is married with two grown children. His predecessor, Tom Ridge, had a family. Anybody remember a debate about whether they would have trouble balancing the demands of work and family?\n\nNow, I am a fan of Gov. Rendell. He has been on this show many times. I like him for his candor. In our attempts to cut through the bull, he delivers far less bull than most politicians. But it is his frankness here that raises so many questions.\n\n1. If a man had been Obama\'s choice for the job, would having a family or not having a family ever even have been an issue? Would it have ever prompted a comment? Probably not. We all know the assumption tends to be that with a man, there is almost always a wife in the wings managing those family concerns.\n\n2. As a woman, hearing this, it is hard not to wonder if we are counted out for certain jobs, certain opportunities, because we do have a family or because we are in our child-bearing years. Are we? It is a fair question.\n\n3. If you are a childless, single woman with suspicions that you get stuck working holidays, weekends and the more burdensome shifts more often than your colleagues with families, are those suspicions well-founded? Probably so. Is there an assumption that if you\'re family-free then you have no life? By some, yes.\n\nAgain Gov. Rendell, I don\'t mean to rake you over the coals. I know what you meant to say. But your comments do perpetuate stereotypes that put us in boxes, both mothers and single women.\n\nIn government and beyond, men have been given the benefit of the doubt when it comes to striking the right work-life balance.

{'text': 'LONDON, England (CNN) -- Previously unseen footage of Diana, Princess of Wales, taken just hours before she was killed in a car crash, has been shown to the jury at the inquest into her death.\n\nThe footage showed Diana and Dodi step into an elevator at the Ritz Hotel.\n\nImages taken from a security camera at the Ritz Hotel in Paris show the 36-year-old smiling as she and her lover Dodi Fayed step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel.\n\nFurther footage shows Fayed visiting a jeweler\'s shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring.\n\nEarlier, a British coroner at the inquest said tt may never be known for certain whether Princess Diana was pregnant when she died in the Paris car crash.\n\nLord Justice Scott Baker told the jury at the inquest into the deaths of the princess and her lover Dodi Fayed that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate "one way or the other" whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy.\n\nBut he said they would hear "intimate" details of her personal life.  Watch footage of Diana\'s last hours »\n\nBaker told the 11 members of the jury -- six women and five men -- Diana may have been on the contraceptive pill and that evidence she was poised to get engaged to Dodi on the night she died was contradictory.\n\nOn Tuesday the judge, who is acting as coroner in the case, told the jury that a famous image taken in summer 1997 showing Diana wearing a swimsuit could not be proof she was pregnant with Dodi\'s child as she had not started a relationship with him at that stage.\n\nThe jury is set to hear "scene setting" evidence, including CCTV and a tourist video.\n\nThe inquest to establish cause of death is expected to be a six-month process.\n\nFayed\'s father, Mohammed Al Fayed, has contended from the start that Diana and his son were murdered because the royal family "could not accept that an Egyptian Muslim could eventually be step-father to the future king of England," referring to Diana\'s son Prince William.\n\n"I\'m hoping for justice," Al Fayed said outside court. "At last, we\'re going to have a jury from ordinary people and I hope to reach the decision which I believe that my son and Princess Diana have been murdered by the royal family."\n\nBaker told the jury of Al Fayed\'s allegations, but again reminded them that they were responsible for deciding the facts of the case, but not to assign blame or guilt.\n\n"You have to decide four important, but limited factual questions: who the deceased were, when they came by their deaths, where they came by their deaths and how they came by their deaths," Baker said, according to inquest transcripts.\n\n"The first three questions are unlikely to give rise to any difficulty. The fourth is a rather wider question and is directed towards the means by which they died."\n\nDiana, 36, and 42-year-old Dodi Fayed were killed on August 31, 1997 when the Mercedes-Benz they were traveling in hit a pillar in the Pont de l\'Alma tunnel in Paris.\n\nThey were being pursued at the time by the paparazzi after leaving the Ritz Hotel. Driver Henri Paul, who was also killed, was drunk and driving at high speed.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A court in Saudi Arabia has granted an 8-year-old girl a divorce from her 47-year-old husband, after twice denying the divorce request previously, local media reported Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe marriage sparked condemnations around the world from human rights groups and U.S. and other government officials when it first came to light in December.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal media, which is highly regulated by the Saudi government, reported that the court in the city of Onaiza approved the divorce decree Thursday, and the divorce is final.\n\n\n\n\n\nA source at the court told the Saudi daily newspaper Al-Watan that the divorce "came after a series of pleas made by a number of officials in the region to the husband."\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN efforts to reach court officials, the husband and the girl\'s father have been unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the attorney for the young girl\'s mother, the father of the girl had arranged the marriage between his daughter and a close friend of his to settle his debts with the man.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the mother went to court to try to get the marriage annulled, Saudi judge Habib al-Habib rejected the request on a legal technicality. The judge ruled that the mother -- who is separated from the girl\'s father -- was not the child\'s legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court, according to the mother\'s lawyer, Abdullah al-Jutaili.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the judge required the girl\'s husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty, al-Jutaili said. The lawyer said in the original marriage agreement, the father of the girl stipulated that the marriage would not be consummated until she was 18.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe judge also ruled that the girl could file a petition for a divorce when she reached puberty, al-Jutaili said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe young girl lives with her mother, the attorney said, and was never told that she was married.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the initial petition to annul the marriage was rejected, the mother appealed the verdict to an appeals court in the Saudi capital of Riyadh. The appeals court declined to certify the original ruling, in essence rejecting al-Habib\'s verdict, and sent the case back to him for reconsideration.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the complicated Saudi legal process, the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect but that a challenge to the marriage was ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, the original judge refused for a second time to annul the marriage.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoon after that decision, Saudi Arabia\'s justice minister told Al-Watan that he planned to enact a law that will protect young girls from such marriages.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law will place restrictions on the practice to preserve the rights of children and prevent abuses, Justice Minister Mohammed Al-Issa was quoted as saying. Additionally, al-Issa said there would be a study of a system that will include regulations for the marriage of minors and everything related to such unions, the newspaper reported. No details on the restrictions or regulations were mentioned.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe minister did not say whether child marriage would be abolished.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponding to the justice minister\'s comments and the possibility of a new child marriage law, al-Jutaili told CNN at the time, "this is what we requested from day one, and we know that Saudi officials are working so hard on resolving this issue."\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Jutaili believes that such a law would help not only his defendant but many other Saudi minors facing a similar problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Washington Monday, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs William Burns called the marriage a human rights abuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Child marriage is, unfortunately, still common in much of Saudi Arabia and we have voiced our concern about this practice at the highest levels," he told a conference on U.S.-Saudi relations. "We were encouraged by reports that the Justice Ministry had begun to review the legal age of marriage."\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the divorce was denied for a second time, the head of the United Nations Children\'s Fund issued a statement expressing concern about the case.\n\n\n\n\n\nUNICEF Executive Director Ann Veneman said, "the right to free and full consent to marriage is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Consent cannot be free and full when either party to a marriage is too young to make an informed decision."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative Saudi kingdom recently. While rights groups have petitioned the government for laws to protect children from such marriages, the kingdom\'s top cleric has said that it\'s OK for girls as young as 10 to wed.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It is incorrect to say that it\'s not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger," Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh, the kingdom\'s grand mufti, said in January, according to the regional Al-Hayat newspaper. "A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married. Those who think she\'s too young are wrong, and they are being unfair to her."\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Sheikh reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls," he said, according to the newspaper. "We should know that sharia law has not brought injustice to women."\n\n\n\n\n\nSharia law is Islamic law, and Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism.', 'qa': [{'question': 'Who is the Saudi justice minister?', 'answers': ['Mohammed Al-Issa']}, {'question': 'What did the father do to settle his debts?', 'answers': ['close friend', 'daughter and', 'arranged the marriage between', 'daughter and a close friend of']}, {'question': 'What is the U.N.?', 'answers': ['United Nations']}, {'question': 'What did Saudi justice minister say he plans to do?', 'answers': ['enact a law that will protect young girls from such marriages.', 'planned']}, {'question': 'What law is planned', 'answers': ['that will protect young girls from such marriages.', 'a']}, {'question': 'What did the child bride win', 'answers': ['a divorce', 'divorce']}, {'question': 'Who won their divorce hearing on the third attempt?', 'answers': ['an 8-year-old girl']}, {'question': 'What did the minister say', 'answers': ['he planned to enact a law that will protect young girls from such marriages.']}, {'question': 'What is a Child bride?', 'answers': ['marriage of minors']}]}
{'text': 'NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Three Staten Island men are charged with violating voting rights, accused of assaulting African-Americans after Barack Obama\'s win in the November presidential election, authorities said Wednesday.\n\n\n\nA grand jury indicted Ralph Nicoletti, 18, Michael Contreras, 18, and Brian Carranza, 21, on charges of conspiracy to interfere with voting rights. All three pleaded not guilty in federal court Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\n\nAccording to the indictment, the three "knowingly and intentionally" conspired to intimidate African-Americans "in the free exercise and enjoyment of a right ... and because of having so exercised that right, to wit, the right to vote."\n\n\n\nNicoletti and Carranza are white, and Contreras is Latino. They face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.\n\n\n\nAt the arraignment, Nicoletti and Contreras were ordered held without bail, while Carranza was released on a $200,000 bond but ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device.\n\n\n\nContreras\' attorney, public defender Len Kamdang, could not be reached for comment. Nicoletti\'s attorney, Bob LaRusso, had no comment.\n\n\n\nProsecutors said in court filings that on the night of November 4, the defendants were at a "makeshift outdoor clubhouse" in the Rosebank section of Staten Island when they learned of Obama\'s victory. At that point, prosecutors said, Nicoletti drove Contreras, Carranza and another friend to the predominantly African-American Park Hill neighborhood in Staten Island.\n\n\n\nTheir purpose, prosecutors said, was to assault African-Americans because of Obama\'s win.\n\n\n\nTheir first victim, according to the U.S. Attorney\'s Office, was 17-year-old Ali Kamara, whom they beat with a metal pipe and a collapsible police baton. Kamara escaped after suffering a concussion and injuries to his legs.\n\n\n\n"The first swing that swung -- it hit my head. It cut my head," Kamara told CNN affiliate WABC. "I got staples on my head now."\n\n\n\nKamara said he hid in a neighbor\'s backyard until the boys moved on.\n\n\n\nContinuing to the Port Richmond section of Staten Island, the group assaulted a second African-American man, pushing him down, the federal prosecutors alleged. They then allegedly accosted a Latino man, demanding to know how he voted, and shouted profanities about Obama at a group of African-Americans at a hair salon.\n\n\n\nNext, prosecutors said, the group targeted Ronald Forte, a man they mistakenly believed to be African-American who was walking along Blackford Avenue in predominantly African-American Port Richmond. Forte is white, but because he was wearing a hoodie, the men were unable to identify his race and assumed that he was African-American.\n\n\n\nAccording to the indictment, the men decided to assault Forte with the police baton as they drove by, but at the last moment, Nicoletti swerved the vehicle directly into the 38-year-old man instead. Forte was thrown onto the hood of the car, shattering the front windshield.\n\n\n\nAccording to Staten Island Real Time News (silive.com), Forte was in a coma for 45 days, returning to his family\'s home in New Jersey in mid-December, said his mother, Eileen. She added that her son now has serious brain damage and motor control problems.\n\n\n\n"He\'s not good. He\'s never going to be good," she said. "Every day, I just see something different, and it\'s so scary."\n\n\n\nU.S. Attorney Benton J. Campbell decried the attacks.\n\n\n\n"Violence and intimidation aimed at interfering with the constitutional rights of every citizen, including the right to vote, will not be tolerated," he said in a written statement.\n\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney\'s Office, Nicoletti has an extensive history of violent criminal activity including burglary, car break-ins, firebombing, assault, and marijuana and cocaine distribution. He is also a member of the "Rosebank Crew" (RBK) founded by his now-incarcerated younger brother, Anthony Nicoletti.\n\n\n\nInvestigators found a cache of weapons and police batons stolen from vehicles owned by police, as well as letters from Nicoletti\'s brother urging Ralph to maintain RBK loyalty and not cooperate with authorities.\n\n\n\nNicoletti and three others approached Contreras three weeks ago at his house, believing he was cooperating with authorities, according to a filing with the U.S. Attorney\'s Office. They allegedly attacked him and called him a snitch, according to a letter from Assistant U.S. Attorneys Pamela Chen and Margo Brodie to the judge in the case.\n\n\n\nThe letter petitions for home confinement, drug testing and other pretrial release conditions for Nicoletti and Carranza.\n\n\n\nThe judge has not responded to the request.\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Mythili Rao and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What three men conspired to intimidate African-Americans?', 'answers': ['Ralph Nicoletti,', 'Ralph Nicoletti, 18, Michael Contreras, 18, and Brian Carranza, 21,', 'Brian Carranza,', 'Michael Contreras,']}, {'question': 'Who pleaded not guilty of conspiracy to interfere with voting rights?', 'answers': ['Michael', 'Carranza,', 'Ralph Nicoletti,', 'Nicoletti,', 'Brian Carranza,', 'Michael Contreras,']}, {'question': 'who is held without bail', 'answers': ['Nicoletti and Contreras']}, {'question': 'How many men were involved in the conspiracy to intimidate?', 'answers': ['Three', 'Three Staten Island']}, {'question': 'What two were held without bail while the other was out with a monitoring device?', 'answers': ['ordered', 'Contreras', 'Ralph Nicoletti,', 'Nicoletti', 'Nicoletti and Contreras', 'Michael Contreras,']}, {'question': 'who conspired to indimidate', 'answers': ['Carranza,', 'Ralph Nicoletti,', 'Contreras,', 'Nicoletti,', 'Three Staten Island men', 'Brian Carranza,', 'Michael Contreras,']}, {'question': 'Who was being intimidated?', 'answers': ['citizen,', 'intimidate African-Americans', 'Ronald Forte,']}, {'question': 'who did the intimidate', 'answers': ['African-Americans']}]}
{'text': '(CNN) -- The Catholic bishop of South Bend, Indiana, will not attend graduation ceremonies at the University of Notre Dame because he disagrees with the stem-cell research and abortion views of the commencement speaker -- President Obama.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe University of Notre Dame says its invitation doesn\'t mean the university agrees with all of Obama\'s positions.\n\n\n\n\n\nBishop John D\'Arcy, whose diocese includes Fort Wayne, Indiana, as well as the university town, said Tuesday in a written statement that "after much prayer" he has decided not to attend the ceremony.\n\n\n\n\n\n"President Obama has recently reaffirmed, and has now placed in public policy, his long-stated unwillingness to hold human life as sacred," D\'Arcy said. "While claiming to separate politics from science, he has in fact separated science from ethics and has brought the American government, for the first time in history, into supporting direct destruction of innocent human life."\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Obama reversed a federal ban on embryonic stem-cell research.

"[T]he spirit of debate and healthy disagreement on important issues is part of what he loves about this country."\n\n\n\n\n\nObama will become the ninth sitting president to give the commencement speech at Notre Dame.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Some Democrats say they fear their party\'s method of picking a nominee might turn undemocratic as neither presidential candidate is likely to gather the delegates needed for the nomination.\n\n\n\nThe Democrats\' superdelegate system is supposed to avoid turmoil at the party\'s conventions.\n\n\n\nSens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are running neck and neck toward the party\'s August convention in Denver, Colorado. Most projections show neither getting the necessary 2,025 delegates in the remaining nominating contests before then.\n\n\n\nParty rules call for the votes of superdelegates -- 800 or so party officers, elected officials and activists -- to tip the balance. The party instituted the system to avoid the turmoil that a deadlocked race would create at a convention.\n\n\n\nBut even some superdelegates are questioning the system, as the party heads toward the conclusion of a race in which they might determine the outcome.\n\n\n\n"It\'s not the most democratic way of doing things," said Maine superdelegate Sam Spencer.  Watch the scenario for a "civil war" in the Democratic Party »\n\n\n\nAt least two organizations have launched petition drives to reflect how the vote went in primaries and caucuses.\n\n\n\nMoveOn.org, which has endorsed Obama, is trying to get 200,000 signatures this week and plans to run an ad with its petition in USA Today. And Democracy for America, headed by Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean\'s brother Jim, said it will deliver signed petitions to all the superdelegates.\n\n\n\nWhile pledged delegates are allocated with the understanding they\'ll vote the way their state went in its primary or caucus, superdelegates are free to vote however they want. And even if they pledge their support to a candidate, they\'re free to change at any time.\n\n\n\nClinton already has 234 superdelegates and Obama has 157. But Obama has a sizable lead in pledged delegates, 1,096 to 977, and is on a roll, having won all eight nominating contests since Super Tuesday.  See which states pledged delegates come from »\n\n\n\nIf the superdelegates were to tip the balance against the popular vote, the turmoil would last long beyond the convention, longtime Democratic Party strategist Tad Devine said.\n\n\n\n"If a perception develops that somehow this decision has been made not by voters participating in primaries or caucuses, but by politicians in some mythical backroom, I think that the public could react strongly against that," Devine said.\n\n\n\n"The problem is [if] people perceive that voters have not made the decision -- instead, insiders have made the decision -- then all of these new people who are being attracted to the process, particularly the young people who are voting for the first time, will feel disenfranchised or in some way alienated," he said.\n\n\n\nSuperdelegates were established in 1982 to bring more moderate Democrats back to conventions, where their attendance had been dropping since the 1950s, and to relect the party\'s mainstream more accurately.\n\n\n\n"[Superdelegates] are the keepers of the faith," said former San Francisco, California, Mayor Willie Brown. "You have superdelegates because this is the Democratic Party. You don\'t want the bleed-over from the Green Party, the independents and others in deciding who your nominee will be."\n\n\n\nDevine was part of the first campaign to benefit from the roles of superdelegates -- that of former Vice President Walter Mondale in 1984.\n\n\n\nMondale\'s 1984 campaign went into the party convention with too few delegates to secure the nomination against the campaigns of former Sen. Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson. Mondale had received more votes, but Hart had won more states.\n\n\n\nMondale was able to line up the superdelegates going into the convention and avoid a fight on the convention floor.\n\n\n\nEach campaign actively is trying to encourage the unpledged delegates to pledge to their side.\n\n\n\nJason Rae, a 21-year-old Wisconsin superdelegate, said he\'s gotten calls from former President Clinton and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright from Hillary Clinton\'s camp, and Obama\'s wife, Michelle, visited with him during a campaign stop Tuesday in Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nRae said he hasn\'t yet decided how he\'ll vote in Wisconsin\'s primary on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nCrystal Strait, a party activist from California, said she\'s received calls from Clinton herself and daughter Chelsea but she remains uncommitted.\n\n\n\nMassachusetts superdelegate John Walsh said he\'ll stay loyal to Obama despite the fact that the senator lost the primary in Walsh\'s state. So will fellow Massachusetts superdelegates Sens. Edward Kennedy and John Kerry.\n\n\n\nAmong Clinton\'s committed superdelegates are Harold Ickes Jr., her husband\'s former deputy chief of staff; Terry McAuliffe, who led her husband\'s 1996 re-election campaign and is chairman of her campaign; and her husband.\n\n\n\nWhether those superdelegates stay committed to their candidates, even if it means tipping the outcome of the race against the pledged delegate lead or the popular vote, could split the party.\n\n\n\n"It\'s in a total contradiction of the way the Democrats have set up their primary process, with all this proportional representation," said CNN political analyst Amy Holmes. "The whole point of it was that no one could walk away with the elites. And if this is decided by superdelegates, I think the Democratic Party morally is going to be looking at each other and say, \'What did we just do?\' "\n\n\n\nDevine said it could hurt the party in the general election.\n\n\n\n"I think it will hurt us particularly because so many of the policies that we\'re saying we will pursue in government as Democrats are based on fairness, whether it\'s the tax policies that we advocate or the social programs we want to advance, there\'s a fairness component in all of that," he said.

But after further study, NASA determined no evasive action would be needed, said Paul Dye, flight director for the space shuttle Discovery, which is en route to the station.\n\n\n\n"The latest tracking information showed it is outside of our area of concern, so the station is going to be right where we expected it to be," Dye told reporters at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.\n\n\n\nDiscovery lifted off from Florida on Sunday for a scheduled docking at 5:13 p.m. ET Tuesday.

{'text': 'DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- It was classic Clinton.\n\n\n\nIt was Sen. Hillary Clinton\'s big night but before her speech even began, former President Bill Clinton reached out in his box and firmly embraced a young African-American man.\n\n\n\nClinton gripped the young man tightly; to millions watching on television, it was clear he could feel Mervyn Jones Jr.\'s pain.\n\n\n\nAs he sat down for his wife\'s headlining address, Bill Clinton\'s silent embrace of the 25-year-old son of recently deceased Ohio Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones resonated loudly.\n\n\n\nRep. Tubbs Jones, of course, was a solid and loyal Clinton supporter, standing by the Clintons even when many other black leaders were shifting their support to Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nThen, in her speech, Sen. Clinton herself took a moment to mention Tubbs Jones and her son.\n\n\n\n"Steadfast in her beliefs, a fighter of uncommon grace, she was an inspiration to me and to us all," Clinton said. "Our heart goes out to Stephanie\'s son, Mervyn Jr."\n\n\n\nThe public moment of recognition was the result of years of friendship.\n\n\n\n" I remember the first time President Clinton ran for office [in 1992]," Jones Jr. told CNN. "He came to Cleveland. I must have been 8 years old.\n\n\n\n"My mother got the chance to meet him. ... They have been best of friends ever since," he said.\n\n\n\nAnd, perhaps, it was also a reminder that if you stand by the Clintons, the Clintons will stand by you.\n\n\n\nTubbs Jones endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in April 2007 but with Sen. Barack Obama\'s success during the primaries, many African-American superdelegates came under pressure to back Obama instead.\n\n\n\nTubbs Jones, however, held steadfast even as others in her position switched their allegiance.\n\n\n\n"I\'m going to be with her until she says, \'Stephanie, I\'m no longer in this fight. You\'re free to do something else,\'" Tubbs Jones told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer in March. "In politics, all you have is your word," she added.\n\n\n\nShe passed that same sense of commitment on to her son.\n\n\n\n"If you give somebody your word, you\'re going to go ahead and do it," Jones Jr. said the day after Hillary Clinton\'s address to the Democratic National Convention. "Otherwise, it\'s not worth anything."\n\n\n\n"The same goes in politics," he added. "If you don\'t have your word, you don\'t really have anything to stand on in politics. So, that\'s one thing I did learn [from my mother] at a very early age."\n\n\n\nWhen Sen. Clinton asked Jones Jr. to sit with her husband during what was perhaps her most important speech to date, he agreed.\n\n\n\n"She always said that if you don\'t stick by somebody in the bad times, you never know how good the good times are going to be," Jones Jr. said, explaining his mother\'s view of loyalty.\n\n\n\nTubbs Jones, 58, died suddenly a week ago of a brain aneurysm. She was in her fifth term in the House of Representatives and was the first African-American woman to represent Ohio in the House.\n\n\n\nWhat would Tubbs Jones have thought of Sen. Clinton\'s call Tuesday for Democrats to unify behind Obama?\n\n\n\n"She would\'ve been standing up, hooting and hollering saying, \'Wow. That\'s exactly what we needed. Way to be a team player,\'" Jones Jr. said.\n\n\n\nIn what some political analysts were calling the first speech of her second campaign for president, Hillary Clinton did her part on stage.\n\n\n\nAnd, in the box, her husband held on tightly to the son of an old friend \xadand sent a message of his own that may resonate as an important moment in the long-term resurrection of the Clinton brand in American politics.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What resonated loudly regarding Bill Clinton?', 'answers': ['silent embrace of the 25-year-old son of recently deceased Ohio Rep.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A federal immigration board rejected an emergency appeal Friday for a stay of deportation filed by the lawyer for Nazi war crimes suspect John Demjanjuk.\n\n\n\nJohn Demjanjuk, shown at his 1993 Israel acquittal, is sought by Germany for alleged killings at a Nazi camp.\n\n\n\nThe decision by the Department of Justice\'s Board of Immigration Appeals in Falls Church, Virginia, clears the way for Demjanjuk\'s deportation to Germany, where he is being sought for his alleged involvement during World War II in killings at Sobibor, a Nazi death camp in Poland.\n\n\n\nThe deportation of Demjanjuk would close a chapter in one of the longest-running pursuits of an alleged Holocaust perpetrator in history, while also paving the way for an extraordinary German war crimes trial.\n\n\n\nAgents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement are now free to pick up Demjanjuk at any point and take him into custody for transport to Germany, a board official said.\n\n\n\nThe appeals board rejected Demjanjuk\'s emergency stay request because it concluded "there is little likelihood of success that his pending motion to re-open the case will be granted," according to board officials.\n\n\n\nThe pending motion argues that a deportation of Demjanjuk, 89, to Germany would constitute torture.\n\n\n\n"In the four years since his deportation was [initially] ordered, his health has seriously deteriorated," Demjanjuk\'s attorney, John Broadley, told CNN in a recent telephone interview.\n\n\n\nBroadley said Demjanjuk suffers from pre-leukemia, kidney problems, spinal problems and "a couple of types of gout."\n\n\n\nThe board, however, has already signaled that argument will be rejected.\n\n\n\nDemjanjuk may make an additional expedited appeal for an emergency stay to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, though his chances of getting the board\'s ruling overturned are believed to be slim, according to Justice Department officials.\n\n\n\nRabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center found irony in Broadley\'s argument for his client.\n\n\n\n"He wants to plead the sense of fairness that he regularly denied all of the victims at Sobibor," Hier said.\n\n\n\nHier called Demjanjuk\'s comparison of his planned deportation to torture "preposterous coming from a person that served the [Nazi organization] S.S. in a death camp. It is a preposterous argument and insulting to the survivors of the Holocaust."\n\n\n\nHier said that 250,000 Jews were killed at the camp, and that none of the guards who worked there was blameless. "You were there for one job: kill the Jews," he said. "And that\'s what they did full-time."\n\n\n\nHe called the evidence against Demjanjuk "overwhelming."\n\n\n\nGerman authorities issued an arrest warrant for Demjanjuk on March 10, accusing him of being an accessory to 29,000 counts of murder as a guard at the death camp from March to September 1943.\n\n\n\nThey studied an identification card provided by the U.S. Office of Special Investigations, and concluded it was genuine, before issuing the warrant.\n\n\n\nDemjanjuk, a retired autoworker living in Cleveland, Ohio, has been fighting charges of Nazi war crimes for more than two decades. He was previously extradited from the United States to Israel, where he was convicted in 1986 of being "Ivan the Terrible," a guard at the notorious Treblinka extermination camp. The conviction was overturned by Israeli courts on appeal, and he returned to the United States.\n\n\n\nThe United States filed new charges against him in 1999, again alleging that he had been a concentration camp guard. He was stripped of U.S. citizenship and has been awaiting deportation since 2005, despite fighting his case all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nDemjanjuk, a Ukrainian, says he fought in the Soviet army and later was a prisoner of war held by the Germans.\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Terry Frieden contributed to this report.', 'qa': [{'question': 'authorities in Germany seek him for involvement in what?', 'answers': ['alleged killings at a Nazi camp.', 'sought by', 'during World War II in killings at Sobibor,']}, {'question': 'Which Nazi camp?', 'answers': ['Germany for alleged killings at a', 'John Demjanjuk, shown at his 1993 Israel acquittal, is sought by Germany for alleged killings at a']}, {'question': 'Demjanjuk is currently what age?', 'answers': ['89,']}, {'question': 'for what reason was he refused', 'answers': ['"there is little likelihood of success that his pending motion to re-open the case will be granted,"']}, {'question': 'wAs he deported', 'answers': ['Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement are now free to pick up Demjanjuk at any point', 'argument will be rejected.']}]}
{'text': 'LONDON, England (CNN) -- There are some circuits that are cornerstones of the Formula 1 calendar: the Monacos and Silverstones whose every twist and turn are known intimately by the drivers and engineers. Then there are the newer circuits -- Malaysia and Bahrain, for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins.\n\nFuji Speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view.\n\nNext week they have something completely new to contend with: a track that has yet to see a single F1 team put in a single lap. The Japan Grand Prix is to return to the Fuji Speedway, a circuit that hasn\'t seen an F1 race since 1977 (though now with a substantially different track layout).\n\nThe Fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games. The old Fuji Speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game Pole Position (released by Namco in Japan and Atari in the rest of the world). The most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of Mount Fuji, Japan\'s tallest mountain, looming in the distance. Though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies.\n\nThe Suzuka track -- which had held Japanese Grands Prix between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike, but for this year and the next the Japanese Grand Prix will be held at Fuji.\n\nHowever an announcement by Formula One Management (FOM) this month revealed that Suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the Japanese Grand Prix alternating yearly between Fuji and Suzuka after that.\n\nBehind the scenes is a political battleground -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with F1 connections -- Honda owns Suzuka, Toyota owns Fuji. Toyota is a relative newcomer to F1 but, having this year surpassed General Motors as the world\'s number one automobile manufacturer, and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock (a position that hasn\'t been reflected in sporting success), it is not without clout.\n\nThe redesign of the Fuji track was carried out by Hermann Tilke in 2003. Tilke, a German architect redesigned a number of F1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including Malaysia, Istanbul, Bahrain and Shanghai, and the tracks for 2008\'s debut grands prix in Singapore and Valencia.\n\nSo how do F1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as Fuji without data from previous races to fall back on? The answer lies with computer simulation.\n\nComputer-aided design (CAD) is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high-tech cars. Every bend, every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself.\n\nDespite never having raced on the circuit, the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual Fuji Speedway for some time. BMW Sauber\'s simulation experts received CAD data from the Japanese race organizers late last year. And when their cars arrive at Fuji for testing next week, their race set-up should be close to optimum.\n\nThe circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments. The radius of each individual segment was measured, allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line (the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance).\n\nThen the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated. The slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car.\n\n"In order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend, we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels, gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance," says Willy Rampf, Technical Director of the BMW Sauber F1 Team.\n\nDieter Glass, Chief Race and Test Engineer with Toyota F1 explains:\n\n"You start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit. Once you know that, you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce, before you get into more detailed simulations of different set-up solutions.\n\n"Getting a bit closer to the weekend, you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy. This prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track, like the degradation of the two Bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time. If you have more fuel in the car, this affects your lap time, but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried."\n\nOne peculiarity of the Fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight, which at 1.475 km (0.916 miles) will allow for higher-than average-straight line speeds but, after the straight the track is relatively twisty. The teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight, and the best grip decelerating into the bends.\n\n"You have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip," says Glass, "and as always you want good grip in general, but you have to balance that with the long straight, where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed."\n\nThe testing may be virtual, but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair\'s breadth away from real world eventualities:\n\n"Our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values," says Rampf.\n\nNot that everything can be predicted: "I think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race," continues Glass.\n\n"Many incidents can happen, which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy."

{'text': '(CNN) -- Searchers have recovered the bodies of three people who were aboard a Yemenia Airways jet that crashed off the coast of Comoros in the Indian Ocean, a spokesman for Yemen\'s Civil Aviation department said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nA man hugs a relative of one of the victims at an airport in Marseille in southern France.\n\n\n\nCapt. Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Qadir also told reporters that a child who was reported found alive was a 5-year-old boy. He did not give further details of the child\'s condition.\n\n\n\n"The French said that (Wednesday) they will send more French units to the accident location in order to retrieve the bodies and possibly that they may be able to locate people who are still alive," he said.\n\n\n\nThe Airbus 310 went down early Tuesday, carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members on a flight that originated in Yemen\'s capital, Sanaa. Qadir said the jet took off from Sanaa shortly before 10 p.m. Monday and vanished from radar when it was about 16 miles from Comoros\' capital, Moroni.\n\n\n\nSearchers have not located the plane\'s data recorders, Qadir said, and investigators were not speculating on the cause of the crash.\n\n\n\n"The weather conditions were indeed very troubling and the winds were very strong, reaching 61 kilometers per hour (38 mph)," he said. "That\'s one thing. The other thing was that the sea was very rough when the plane approached landing at Moroni airport."\n\n\n\nBut French Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau noted that several years ago France banned the plane, a A310-300, because of safety concerns.\n\n\n\n"People are talking about poor weather conditions, but for the moment, we are unsure," Bussereau said. "It seems the plane may have attempted an approach, put on the gas, and attempted another approach, which then failed. For the moment, we must be careful because none of this information is verified."\n\n\n\nQadir said it was too early to blame the aircraft for the crash.\n\n\n\n"This plane is just like any other plane," he said. "It can have a malfunction, but we don\'t know what really happened before the investigation is over. And then we can determine if there is a technical issue, bad weather or anything else that may have led to the crash."\n\n\n\nIt was the second crash involving an Airbus jet in a month. On June 1, an Air France Airbus A330 crashed off Brazil while en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France. All 228 aboard are presumed dead. The cause remains under investigation.  Recent plane crashes »\n\n\n\nFormer pilot and aviation analyst John Cox said there were no similarities between the two incidents.\n\n\n\n"These are two dramatically different airplanes flown by two different airlines," Cox told CNN\'s "American Morning."\n\n\n\n"The accidents happened at two different regimes of flight. And Airbus has hundreds of millions of hours flying safely. I don\'t believe that ... we can draw any conclusions because the manufacturer was the same in these two very different types of accidents."\n\n\n\nAt first, Comoros officials said there were no signs of survivors among the dead bodies floating in the choppy waters. But then rescuers found the child.  Watch as airline describes child\'s rescue »\n\n\n\nCox said it reminded him of the 1987 crash of Northwest Flight 255 in Detroit, Michigan, in which only a 4-year-old girl survived while 156 others died.\n\n\n\n"This has come up before, and it\'s where the toddler was seated (during the impact) that allowed them to survive," he said.\n\n\n\n"It\'s a miracle and I\'m glad ... the toddler is safe. I\'m just saddened for the loss of everybody else," he added.\n\n\n\nThe Yemeni crash occurred as the plane approached the Hahaya airport in Moroni. The plane tried to land, then U-turned before it crashed, Comoros Vice President Idi Nadhoim said. Officials did not know why the plane could not land, he said.\n\n\n\nFlight 626 was expected to be a four-and-a-half-hour flight. The airline has three regular flights a week to Moroni, off the east coast of Africa, about 2,900 km (1,800 miles) south of Yemen.\n\n\n\nThe crash occurred about 1:30 a.m., Nadhoim said.\n\n\n\nThere was no indication of foul play behind the crash, the official in Yemen said.\n\n\n\nYemenia Air had used the jet since 1999 on about 17,300 flights, Airbus officials said. The company said it would assist in investigating the crash.\n\n\n\n"The concerns and sympathy of the Airbus employees go to the families, friends and loved ones affected by the accident," the company said in a statement.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the Air France crash on June 1, United States accident investigators have been probing two recent failures of airspeed and altitude indications aboard Airbus A330s.   One flight was between the United States and Brazil in May, and the other between Hong Kong and Japan in June. The planes landed safely and there were no injuries or damage, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Saad Abedine and Ayesha Durgahee contributed to this report', 'qa': [{'question': 'Which country is sending a team?', 'answers': ['French']}, {'question': 'Where was a 5-year old boy recovered from?', 'answers': ['off the coast of Comoros', 'Yemenia Airways jet', 'off the coast of Comoros in the Indian Ocean,']}, {'question': 'Was the child recovered from the Yemeni jet crash found alive?', 'answers': ['a 5-year-old boy.', 'bodies of three people', 'who', 'reported']}, {'question': 'How many people were aboard the Jet?', 'answers': ['three', '142 passengers and 11 crew members', '228']}, {'question': 'Who was recovered alive from the crash?', 'answers': ['child', 'a 5-year-old boy.', 'reported found']}, {'question': 'How many bodies have been found?', 'answers': ['three', '156']}, {'question': 'When did the crash occur?', 'answers': ['off the coast of Comoros', 'Monday', 'early Tuesday,']}, {'question': 'How many people was the jet carrying?', 'answers': ['142 passengers and 11 crew members']}]}

{'text': '(CNN) -- Decorating in the midst of a financial recession is not easy. But Thom Filicia, host of the Style Network\'s "Dress My Nest," author of "Thom Filicia Style" and former cast member of "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," insists that it can be done.\n\n"Paint is very affordable. Pick a color that has life and personality," Thom Filicia says.\n\n"I always tell people, \'Start with what you have.\' Work as much with what you have as possible, and then fill in where necessary," Filicia said.\n\nCNN recently asked the design guru about decorating on a budget and helpful tips to make your home look its best.\n\nCNN: When you walk into a room that you\'re going to redesign, where does your mind first go?\n\nThom Filicia: I look at the layout, I look at the way the space is being used, and I try to figure out what the best use of the space is; that it works really well, it looks good, that you\'re getting the best views, you\'re seeing the space, and that you\'re getting through the space.\n\nCNN: And that\'s focusing mainly on furniture?\n\nFilicia: That really focuses on all the furniture. You want to look at where the rug is and where the sofa is and coffee tables and chairs -- just how the room works. Even if it\'s great-looking stuff, it sometimes doesn\'t look as good as it can look.\n\nCNN: What can people on a tight budget do to rearrange their living room and make it look better with what they have?\n\nFilicia: Make sure that your furniture layout works. Make sure that the things you love to look at, you\'re seeing. Make sure things aren\'t cluttered.\n\nPaint is very affordable. Pick a color that has life and personality. You could do an accent wall behind your sofa. You could use a low-[volatile organic compound] paint so it\'s environmentally friendly.\n\nYou can use inexpensive up lights. You put them on either side of a piece of furniture or behind a tree. You always want to have a Lutron dimmer you plug into the wall. And then plug your lamps into the Lutron dimmer, and you can dim the whole room.\n\nCNN: As far as accessories go, like flowers and pillows, where do you draw the line on too much or not enough?\n\nFilicia: I like to keep things clean and straightforward. I think one floral arrangement is usually enough, or maybe a couple really small cute little ones.\n\nPillows should function. You want to sit on a sofa and be comfortable. Start with three: one lumbar in the center and maybe a pair of pillows left and right. Add a throw, a rug for underfoot. Those things start to add layers to the room and make it a little more acoustical.\n\nCNN: What are some common designing rules that people always tend to follow but that you can actually break?\n\nFilicia: People think that dark walls make a room smaller. It actually makes the space bigger. All the corners recede, and it adds a lot of depth. Also, I think that color definitely adds a lot of warmth to spaces.\n\nCNN: What\'s the most common mistake that people make?\n\nFilicia: People just don\'t trust their instincts, and they\'re not willing to take a risk. Have fun with it. It\'s only decorating. People tend to go with beige and white just because they\'re afraid or they don\'t want to make a commitment.\n\nCNN: If someone had just enough money to do one thing in their room, what would you tell them to focus on?\n\nFilicia: The first thing you want to really focus on is a great sofa, because it is really the anchor for the room. In a bedroom, the anchor piece is your bed. Start with your anchor piece, and that\'s where you spend your most money.\n\nCNN: You have a new book out now, is that right?\n\nFilicia: Yup, I have a book out right now, which is called "Thom Filicia Style," and it\'s a great book. It\'s a lot of fun. It\'s got a lot of great tips in it. It talks about my philosophy; it talks about color and texture. It\'s a very comprehensive book with case studies.\n\nCNN: Can you give us some tips for making a place eco-friendly on a tight budget?\n\nFilicia: It\'s very easy to use eco-friendly cleaning supplies, environmentally friendly lighting throughout your house using low wattage or eco-friendly bulbs. Also, just turning your lights off when you\'re not in a room; when you\'re brushing your teeth not keeping the water running; taking shorter showers.

{'text': '(CNN) -- We have a tendency, when things in the news get bad, to tell ourselves that it\'s never been quite this dismal before.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are tempted, when disputes become particularly acrimonious, to believe that the current bitterness is unprecedented.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it\'s beneficial, once in a while, to look at our current problems in light of what has gone before.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd to remember just how much the United States has endured.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe newspaper USA Today reported last week that there has been a sharp increase in the unemployment rate for male veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The paper said that such unemployment has tripled since the recession began, having reached 15 percent last month. More than 250,000 of the male veterans were said to be unemployed last month, with another 400,000 having left the workforce for various reasons: to raise children, or attend college, or because they have just stopped trying to find work.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Davis, a spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said: "It makes you almost want to go out and rip off all the \'Support Your Troops\' bumper stickers. If you want to support your troops, give them a job."\n\n\n\n\n\nCan\'t argue with that. After what American soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are asked to sacrifice, there is something melancholy about the thought of them coming home and having trouble finding a way to support their families.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nation is likely to work on a solution to this honorably and in good faith.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a time, during parallel circumstances, when that wasn\'t the case. It was one of the darkest moments in American history, and few people speak about it anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shorthand for it was "the Bonus Army."\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the spring and summer of 1932, with the Great Depression gripping the country, tens of thousands of World War I veterans and their families gathered in Washington to demand what they felt they had been promised. They set up shantytowns, and vowed to stay put until their entreaties were met.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government had, in 1924, issued service certificates -- redeemable for bonuses -- to the soldiers who had returned from World War I. The certificates were intended to reward the veterans for the time they had spent fighting for their country. They were like long-term bonds -- they could not be redeemed until 1945.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut something happened between 1924 and 1932: The economy collapsed. Poverty and joblessness were everywhere. The veterans, many of them hungry and destitute, came to Washington asking Congress to allow them to collect their bonuses early.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt didn\'t happen. The U.S. Senate voted down the bill.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo there were the military veterans, amassed in the nation\'s capital. Out of money, out of luck, almost out of hope, they refused to leave. The government ordered their evacuation. Many of the veterans resisted; the police shot and killed two of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith that, the president of the United States, Herbert Hoover, fearing that radicals had infiltrated the veterans, ordered the Army to take over the involuntary evacuation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this country was confronted with the news that the Army was moving against the old soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the highest level of the Army assigned to the task were men who would later become extraordinarily famous. Gen. Douglas MacArthur was in command; Maj. Dwight D. Eisenhower was the go-between with the local police force; Maj. George Patton was in charge of the cavalry.\n\n\n\n\n\nBayonets were drawn; tanks and soldiers on horseback advanced into the crowds; acrid gas was unleashed on the protesting veterans; the makeshift camps were torn down. Even though President Hoover didn\'t want it to happen, MacArthur sent his troops across a bridge to the site of the veterans\' main living quarters. A fire broke out; it was never determined with certainty who set it, but there it was: the American veterans\' cobbled-together homes in flames, as the Army drove them out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was no television back then; it is almost impossible to fathom what would have happened if the country had been able to see, live, the military moving relentlessly against former members of the military who were asking for the means to survive.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs rugged as the economy is now -- and as difficult a time as some veterans are having as they look for work in a dismal hiring environment -- no one foresees a day when soldiers will again be ordered to roust former soldiers and their families.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater in their lives, MacArthur, Eisenhower and Patton all lamented, with varying degrees of emotion, having had to play a role in driving the Bonus Army out of Washington. Their commander in chief had decreed that it must be done, so they carried out his orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\'ve come a long way since then; no president with an eye toward his legacy would order the Army to do such a thing, and it\'s hard to believe that military officials would not, behind closed doors, try everything in their power to avoid having to use American troops that way.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as much as things have changed, certain truths haven\'t. We ask our soldiers, in times of war, to cross the oceans and fight in our name. When they come home -- those who do come home alive -- we tell them, in bad economic times, that the jobs for them are just not there.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf our soldiers want to work, we owe it to them to make it easier for that to happen. There may never again, we should hope, be a Bonus Army camped in the streets of Washington, pleading for help. The best way to prevent such a sight is to provide the help before the despair of the unemployed veterans reaches that breaking point.

"But apparently, none of this matters" to GOP leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I\'ve gone out of my way to find areas of cooperation" with congressional Republicans, the president declared. "We\'re going to give members of Congress another chance to step up to the plate and do the right thing."\n\n\n\n\n\nBut "if they vote against these proposals again ... then they\'re not going to have to answer to me. They\'re going to have to answer to you," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater Monday, Obama told students at West Wilkes High School in Millers Creek that Republican opposition to his plan "makes no sense," and he criticized the GOP alternative proposal as an attempt to satisfy the party\'s conservative wing.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It\'s way overdue for us to stop trying to satisfy some branch of the party and take some common-sense steps to help" the economy and the nation, he said to a cheering crowd.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Obama\'s plan was rejected in the Senate -- due to unanimous GOP opposition -- Democratic leaders have decided to try to move it through Congress by breaking it up into a series of smaller legislative proposals.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut his appearance, analysts note, was as much about campaign politics as the bill. The president will spend the next three days on a bus tour through politically pivotal North Carolina and Virginia -- two states carried by Obama in 2008 but considered up for grabs next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nVeteran Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, whom Obama defeated in the 2008 election, criticized the president Monday for using the taxpayer-funded trip for what McCain called political campaigning.\n\n\n\n\n\n"On the taxpayer-paid dime, the president is now traveling, attacking the Republican plan," McCain said on the Senate floor. While noting Obama\'s right to level such criticism in a political venue, McCain added: "Is that appropriate on the taxpayer\'s dime, since it is clearly campaigning?"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Asheville, the crowd repeatedly chanted "four more years" before and during Obama\'s remarks.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I appreciate the \'four more years,\' but right now, I\'m thinking about the next 13 months," the president said. "We don\'t have time to wait. We\'ve got a choice right now."\n\n\n\n\n\nObama\'s senior strategist, David Axelrod, vowed Sunday that every part of the bill will eventually have a vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The American people support every single plank of that bill, and we\'re going to vote on every single one of them," Axelrod said on ABC\'s "This Week."\n\n\n\n\n\nHe would not say which part of the plan would come first.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans will "get a vote on whether they believe we should protect tax breaks for small business owners and middle-class Americans, or whether we should protect tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires," Obama said in a written statement last Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, demonstrators in Southern California said they\'d gather Monday to protest the GOP\'s stance on the president\'s jobs bill. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and California Reps. Dana Rohrabacher and Ed Royce will be together in the area for a fundraising event.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Members of the Courage Campaign, teachers and health care workers will deliver a petition to Speaker Boehner signed by 25,000 Courage Campaign members ... demanding that he hold a vote on President Obama\'s American Jobs Act," a statement from the demonstrators said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said over the weekend that there could be agreement on some elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Let\'s work together. Let\'s find some of the things in his plan that we agree with, and let\'s go ahead and do that for the American people," he told "Fox News Sunday."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe past week was an indication that "we can come together," Cantor said, citing the passage of three trade bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nCantor did not make clear exactly where areas of agreement may be. But he cited the need to help small businesses find capital, unemployment insurance reform and infrastructure spending as broad ideas for which both sides have expressed support.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut "we\'re not going to be for tax increases on small businesses," Cantor said of the president\'s plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans filibustered the Senate version of the president\'s jobs bill last week, though a handful of Democrats had said they would have opposed the measure if it had made it to the chamber\'s floor.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong other things, Obama\'s overall blueprint includes an extension and expansion of the current payroll tax cut, an extension of jobless benefits, new tax credits for businesses that hire the long-term unemployed and additional money to help save and create jobs for teachers and first responders such as firefighters.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe largest measure in the package is the payroll tax cut, which comes at a projected cost of $265 billion. Employees normally pay 6.2% on their first $106,800 of wages into Social Security, but they are now paying only 4.2%. That break is set to expire at the end of December. Obama wants to cut the tax in half, to 3.1%.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans previously embraced the cut, but have increasingly questioned its economic merit.\n\n\n\n\n\nA second key measure -- estimated to cost roughly $44 billion -- is the extension of emergency jobless benefits to help the long-term unemployed. Lawmakers first expanded benefits to cover 99 weeks in 2009, and have since reauthorized the expansion five times.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans are at particularly sharp odds with Democrats over how to pay for the plan. GOP leaders oppose a provision that would fund the measure through a 5.6% surtax on annual incomes over $1 million. Republicans have accused the president of engaging in so-called "class warfare," while Democrats say wealthier Americans need to share in the cost of fiscal responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, a Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN that Democrats will seek a 0.5% surtax on annual incomes over $1 million to pay for the first individual component of Obama\'s broader jobs package.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat component of the larger jobs bill would provide $35 billion in aid to states to help preserve jobs for teachers and first responders, the White House and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\'s office said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a top Senate Republican leadership aide immediately said that Republicans -- and some Democrats -- probably would not be willing to go along with a tax increase to pay for the measure.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Ted Barrett, Kate Bolduan and Virginia Nicolaidis contributed to this report.', 'qa': [{'question': 'The White House has called on what to pass the jobs bill incrementally?', 'answers': ['you,"', 'Republicans']}, {'question': 'How many days is the visit to North Carolina and Virginia?', 'answers': ['three']}, {'question': 'who visits North Carolina and Virginia?', 'answers': ['Barack Obama', 'The president', 'President Barack Obama']}, {'question': 'The two states are key battlegrounds', 'answers': ['North Carolina', 'Virginia']}, {'question': 'Who says Obama is campaigning on a taxpayer-funded trip?', 'answers': ['John McCain,', 'McCain']}, {'question': 'who criticized Obama?', 'answers': ['Sen.

"We were all terrified of another attack on this country because September 11 was the worst day of my life in government -- watching 3,000 Americans die because these people attacked us."

The man\'s body was found Monday less than 150 feet from shore, Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad said.\n\n\n\nThe Coast Guard launched two more search missions Tuesday morning for four men and one woman still missing. Authorities have not released their identities, nor the name of the man found Monday.\n\n\n\n"The Coast Guard will continue to search as long as there is the possibility of finding any survivors," Castrodad said.\n\n\n\nEighteen divers will conduct searches Tuesday in the area where the body was found, the Coast Guard spokesman said.\n\n\n\nVolunteer divers from Arecibo found the body Monday, said Jose Daniel Echeverria, spokesman for the Puerto Rico Emergency Management Agency, which also is involved in the search.\n\n\n\nAs of Tuesday, the Coast Guard will have conducted 12 search operations, eight done by four HH-65 Dolphin helicopters from Air Station Borinquen and four by the Cutter Matinicus, Castrodad said.\n\n\n\nThe search is complicated, he said, by the roughness of the area.\n\n\n\n"It\'s like a cliff," he said. "The surf is very rough. It\'s hard to get in that area."\n\n\n\nSmaller boats from the emergency management agency and the Puerto Rico Police Joint Forces for Rapid Action are being used because they can reach areas that the Coast Guard cutter cannot, Castrodad said.\n\n\n\nThe private plane, chartered by Tropical Aviation Corp., took off from the Dominican Republic and was on its way to an airport in Puerto Rico when it went down Sunday evening, officials said.\n\n\n\nThe four males and one female onboard were returning to Puerto Rico after spending the weekend in the Dominican Republic, said Noemi Corporan, service manager for Tropical Aviation. The passengers were San Juan residents and had flown to the Dominican Republic on Friday, she said.\n\n\n\nThe airplane took off from Casa de Campo International Airport in the Dominican Republic and was supposed to land at the Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in Carolina to clear U.S. customs before going on to the Isla Grande Airport in San Juan, the Coast Guard said.\n\n\n\nA 911 emergency operator notified the Coast Guard at 6:51 p.m. Sunday that an aircraft had crashed into the waters off Quebradillas.

{'text': 'JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- White students at a South African university tricked black residence hall workers into eating stew containing urine, prompting a march Wednesday in which five people were arrested, university officials said.\n\n\n\nStudents protest against a racist video on the campus of Free State University in Bloemfontein, South Africa.\n\n\n\nThe white students made a video of the incident, which they staged in reaction to the university\'s efforts to integrate its residences, according to a statement from the University of the Free State.\n\n\n\nThe protesters on Wednesday included black and white students who later marched to the residence where the video was made and demanded that it be shut down, witnesses said.\n\n\n\nThe video surfaced on Tuesday but was made in September, the university said.\n\n\n\nIn the video, white male students at Reitz Residence are seen encouraging at least three black female housekeepers to participate in what the students call the "Reitz Fear Factor," an apparent reference to the television show in which contestants eat live worms or compete in other feats.  Watch excerpts of video that sparked outrage »\n\n\n\nIn one scene from the video, a student mixes what looks like a beef stew in a plastic bowl and adds garlic and other items. Then he tells the camera he will add the "special ingredient."\n\n\n\nThe student then urinates into the mixture, which he later stirs up and puts in a microwave. Other students can be heard laughing on the tape.\n\n\n\nThe next scene shows a different student urging at least three housekeepers to drink cups full of the stew, saying, "This is our dorm\'s \'Fear Factor.\' We want to see who has the best \'Fear Factor.\'"\n\n\n\nOn the video, the student does not tell the women that there is urine in the mixture.\n\n\n\nThe women, on their knees, spit the stew into buckets after tasting it. Some appeared to vomit, but the women also laughed during the incident as the student urged them on.\n\n\n\nNext, the women struggle to run in what appears to be a race. The video is put in slow-motion as the theme from "Chariots of Fire" plays.\n\n\n\nFinally, one of the students awards a large bottle of whiskey to one of the women, telling her she has won the "Fear Factor."\n\n\n\nAt the end of the video, a message appears on the screen in Afrikaans saying, "That, at the end of the day, is what we think of integration."\n\n\n\nUniversity officials and human rights groups in South Africa denounced the video.\n\n\n\n"The executive management of the [university] condemns this video in the strongest possible terms as a gross violation of the human dignity of the workers involved," said UFS Rector Frederick Fourie in a statement posted on the university\'s Web site.\n\n\n\n"We have immediately started with a most urgent investigation into this matter," he added.\n\n\n\nLater Wednesday, Fourie met with the employees seen in the video and apologized to them, a statement from the university said. Counseling is being provided for the workers, it added.\n\n\n\nThe students involved in the video have been identified and will be suspended, Fourie said, and charges against the men will be filed with the South African Police Service.\n\n\n\nTwo of the students in the video are still enrolled at the university but had been barred from the campus in Bloemfontein, according to the university. Two others completed their studies last year.\n\n\n\nThe students seen in the video have not made any public comment since the video surfaced.\n\n\n\n"I am deeply saddened that students apparently see nothing wrong in producing such an offensive and degrading video. I have publicly said several times that the UFS is not a place for racism," the rector\'s statement said.\n\n\n\n"The fact that it is openly linked to the integration process in UFS residences is also most disturbing," Fourie said.\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman in Free State province for the Democratic Alliance -- an opposition party which says it puts equal rights for all South Africans at the center of its policies -- called the video "shocking and inhumane."\n\n\n\n"It looked like they were willing [participants] but they didn\'t know what purpose the video served. ... It was quite humiliating at the end to see the quite senior ladies on their knees eating the meat," said spokeswoman Liana Van Wyk, the South African Press Association reported.\n\n\n\nHelen Zille, the Democratic Alliance\'s leader, Wednesday asked the South African Human Rights Commission to conduct an investigation into racial tensions at the university.\n\n\n\n"The abhorrent footage of students abusing university workers is a fundamental infringement on the victims\' constitutional right to have their dignity respected and protected," Zille said in a statement posted on the group\'s Web site.\n\n\n\n"This incident is symptomatic of racial tensions that have been simmering at the campus for some time over the issue of hostel [residence] integration," she said.\n\n\n\nFourie acknowledged in his statement that "the university is going through a difficult time with its efforts to racially integrate its residences and to create a new residence culture based on diversity, respect, human dignity and human rights."\n\n\n\nHe added, "These kinds of actions make it all the more important that we succeed with establishing such a new institutional culture on the campus.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Comedian George Carlin, known for pushing the envelope with his use of profanity and for pointing out the silliness and hypocrisy of human life, died of heart failure Sunday. He was 71.\n\n\n\niReporter Kevin Eckhoff met George Carlin at a show in St. Louis, Missouri, in 2004.\n\n\n\niReporter Chris Sargent says, "He could play with words and phrases in ways that would put the most highly regarded English professors and linguists to shame."\n\n\n\nCNN.com invited readers to share tales of meeting Carlin, and the impact he had on their lives. Below is a selection of their responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\n\nMelanie Phillips of Salem, Oregon: I met George Carlin in the early \'70s at a performance he gave at Los Angeles Valley College. The large auditorium was filled to capacity so they closed the doors leaving about 40 people outside. When Carlin came up on stage he asked, "Who are all those people staring in the windows?" The host told him the fire marshal had locked them out.\n\n\n\nCarlin thought for a moment then asked, "How many people are allowed to be on stage?" The legal limit was 50. The comedian turned to the audience and said, "Forty of you people in the first few rows come up on stage and give those people outside your seats." My friend and I ran up on stage and we all gathered in a circle around him, like at a campfire. For the next 90 minutes, Carlin did his entire act by taking our requests, "Hippy Dippy Weatherman," "Seven Words ..."\n\n\n\nAfter the show was over, he passed through our little circle, shaking hands (including mine) as he quickly made his way off stage to avoid being swamped by fans. It was one of my most memorable experiences and a grand gesture for the 40 fans who had been locked out.\n\n\n\nAlexis Karlin of Boston, Massachusetts: When I was little my dad had this box car and one day he put a George Carlin tape in it and it got stuck. So for a year until the car died we listened to this George Carlin tape over and over and over again. ...\n\n\n\nI won\'t miss that car but I will miss George Carlin.\n\n\n\nChris Sargent of Laurel, Maryland: Last night, the world\'s greatest comedian and champion of the First Amendment, George Carlin, died at the age of 71 from heart failure. He was one of the few things my father and I had in common, as I have fond memories of sitting in the living room with him, watching George on HBO, and laughing our a***s off.\n\n\n\nHis gift was to make us think about everything. He could play with words and phrases in ways that would put the most highly regarded English professors and linguists to shame.\n\n\n\nKevin Eckhoff of Jacksonville, Illinois: George was in classic form as he arrived for a show in late 2004 at the Touhill Performing Arts Center in St. Louis. This was my second time meeting George. He signed the photo from our first meeting, took this new photo, and then proceeded to begin signing my friend\'s albums. Before he started, he paused, fanned out the records, looked at each, and in his own special way said, "You know, I go from city to city and you guys (autograph collectors) always have my records in such great shape.

The three-day ticket price may have been steep -- roughly $300, including service charges -- but when divided among the 131 acts on the bill, that breaks down to less than $2.50 per act.\n\n\n\nThis was also the first year concert promoter Goldenvoice offered layaway, which is how 18 percent chose to pay. The strong showing is good news for Bonnaroo, All Points West, Lollapalooza and other festivals taking place this spring and summer. Coachella was also moved up one weekend, which allowed for more kids on spring break to attend.\n\n\n\nAlthough Coachella is one of several music festivals in the United States, it still carries a certain cachet that\'s hard to match. Perhaps it\'s the scenery -- listening to music on a grassy polo field surrounded by swaying palm trees and craggy desert mountains. Or maybe it\'s the thrill of discovering new artists and rediscovering old ones standing shoulder-to-shoulder with friends, strangers and the random Hollywood celebrity.\n\n\n\nOr maybe it\'s the wacky moments that seem to happen only under the blistering desert sun.\n\n\n\nWhere else could you get Morrissey -- a well-known vegetarian -- complaining in the middle of his Friday set that the smell of burning animals was making him sick, and that he only hoped it was human? The Moz was referring to meat grilling in a food booth across the polo field.\n\n\n\nAnd when troubled British neo-soul singer Amy Winehouse dropped out of her Saturday performance because she couldn\'t get a visa, M.I.A. stepped into her slot on the main stage -- but she apparently wasn\'t happy about the upgrade. Despite a massive, adoring crowd and a highly charged set, the new mom exclaimed, "This is the main stage? Next time, I\'m back in a tent!

Sunday headliners The Cure played 31 songs from the group\'s vast catalog -- concentrating heavily on early material, and for the most part, staying away from the biggest radio hits. They, too, played well past curfew -- continuing with their third encore even after the sound from the main PA system was cut off.\n\n\n\nMy Bloody Valentine -- whose four members reunited last year after a decade apart -- was also a crowd pleaser, although an interlude where they played a single chord at maximum decibels for a mind-numbing 15 minutes left fans scratching their heads.\n\n\n\nPerry Farrell is the only artist who\'s performed at all 10 Coachella festivals -- in Jane\'s Addiction, Porno for Pyros, Satellite Party, as his alter ego DJ Peretz and in other incarnations.

My mental health depends on them," he said with a laugh.\n\n\n\nDespite a time of belt-tightening, festivalgoers are finding a way to let it all hang out.

{'text': 'JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Hugh Masekela is the legendary South African musician whose songs were an inspiration in the fight to end apartheid. He tells CNN about growing up under apartheid, why he left South Africa and what is was like to move back to Johannesburg after 30 years away.\n\n\n\nHugh Masekela: "The people of South Africa deserve entertainment, recreation and freedom."\n\n\n\nCNN: How did the suffering of the apartheid influence your art?\n\n\n\nHugh Masekela: I don\'t think what I do is influenced by suffering. I come from a talented people who are prolific in music and dance. We have wonderful singers and we have a diversity of music here that is just amazing.\n\n\n\nBut in spite of being oppressed these people were very resilient and they were mostly resilient through song. I think we are the only society where music played such a major part in our resistance.\n\n\n\nWe grew up in rallies and in the street. We didn\'t have televisions so we played in the streets and made up songs about what was happening.\n\n\n\nWatch Hugh Masekela take CNN on a tour of Johannesburg ».\n\n\n\nCNN: What\'s your earliest memory of Johannesburg?\n\n\n\nHM: I came to Jo\' burg from Springs [a town near Johannesburg]. My family moved to Alexandra township and the first time I went to town alone I must have been 10 or 11. Jo\' burg used to be scrubbed every night with fire hoses and those hard brooms and the granite on the sidewalks would always sparkle. I remember that because I came from Alexander township where there were no lights, no sewage and no cafes.\n\n\n\nThe most vivid memory I have -- we used to stop and look through restaurant windows at the white people eating fancy food, and we\'d say "what do you think that is?" and "there are so many types of food!"\n\n\n\nCNN: How did it feel to leave South Africa?\n\n\n\nHM: When I left South Africa in 1960 I was 20 years old. I wanted to try to get an education and music education was not available for me in South Africa. I wanted to learn from the same kind of teachers that taught Miles Davis and Clifford Brown and Chad Baker and they were not in South Africa. I hoped that one day I could go and learn some of those things and then come back and teach.\n\n\n\nIt was a rough time, when the apartheid government first started showing that if you don\'t behave, they\'ll shoot you -- women and children too. You saw police with guns, with machine guns, and for the first time you saw tanks.\n\n\n\nWe had a group called the Jazz Epistles and we were about to take off on a national tour. We were the first African group to play on an LP, but gatherings of more than 10 people were banned so we couldn\'t do our tour.\n\n\n\nBut four years later, when I was ready to come back to South Africa, I couldn\'t. The place was impenetrable. By then Mandela had been sentenced to life imprisonment. So I stayed 26 years longer than I planned to.\n\n\n\nSee Hugh Masekela\'s Johannesburg »\n\n\n\nCNN: Tell us about coming home.\n\n\n\nHM: It was great, but it was also a tense time coming back to South Africa and we were not naive about it. It was a time of real turmoil. There were no-go places in the townships, there was sniping, there were major clashes and it was a time when civil war was threatening.\n\n\n\nWhen I left South Africa there were 10 million people -- when I came back there were more than 40 million. I had to learn how to get to the highways because when I left where there were no highways. And I had to adjust my language because people would say "we don\'t\' talk like that anymore!" I was like a sponge trying to learn to do the right things.\n\n\n\nNot many people came back from exile compared with those who left. About a million left -- 50,000 came back, and of those about 25,000 did a U-turn because it wasn\'t easy. It wasn\'t easy but it\'s been a great experience.\n\n\n\nCNN: How would you define the culture of Jo\' burg?\n\n\n\nHM: There\'s no one culture -- it\'s a cosmopolitan city. It\'s so diverse, like South Africa itself has so many diverse cultures.\n\n\n\nBut again, we are still living in the culture of ethnic grouping. If we could beat that and have a major festival of tolerance, it would be the shining path.\n\n\n\nCNN: Where do you like to go out in Jo\' burg?\n\n\n\nHM: I go to Newtown, I go to the Market Theater a lot, and also to the Dance Forum, because we have very brilliant dance choreographers. Old Jo\' burg was vibrant, there were things going on all the time -- concerts, festivals, clubs -- but in the last 10 years or so it has become a very quiet city at night.\n\n\n\nCNN: What is life like in the city?\n\n\n\nHM: It\'s not very easy to enjoy the city because the safety and security is not such that you can just go anywhere any time. There\'s a sadness about this city that everybody talks about.\n\n\n\nPeople in South Africa have become inward; they spend most of the time in their homes. When it gets dark, everyone wants to go home as quickly as they can. That is not only Jo\' burg\'s problem, it is a national problem.\n\n\n\nWhat we\'re talking about doesn\'t make me very popular with the people who run this country, but it\'s nothing new -- you see it in the newspapers every day.\n\n\n\nIt has to be fixed, because the people of South Africa deserve entertainment, recreation and freedom to enjoy the beauty of their country and to show guests around and say "this is my country."', 'qa': [{'question': "He couldn't return because of what?", 'answers': ['The place was impenetrable.']}, {'question': 'What makes Johannesburg and South Africa so cosmopolitan?', 'answers': ['many diverse cultures.', 'diverse,', "It's"]}, {'question': 'Who is Hugh Masekela?', 'answers': ['South African musician']}, {'question': "Who's songs were the inspiration?", 'answers': ['Hugh Masekela']}, {'question': 'Where is Johannesburg?', 'answers': ['South Africa']}, {'question': 'What was the inspiration?', 'answers': ['South African musician whose songs', 'in the fight to end apartheid.', 'Hugh Masekela:', 'is the legendary South African musician', 'Hugh Masekela']}]}

Three people suffered minor injuries, officials said.\n\n\n\nFay\'s maximum sustained winds remained near 65 mph, with higher gusts, forecasters said. A storm tracker in Moore Haven, near the west bank of Lake Okeechobee, reported winds up to 81 mph in the afternoon.\n\n\n\n"Some fluctuations in intensity are likely this afternoon and tonight as Fay moves inland over Florida.

{'text': 'Sara, 29, has lived in Miami for five years, where she works as freelance writer and film maker. Her blog, All Purpose Dark, keeps tabs on the city\'s nightlife and restaurants, and she is also the editor of the Miami edition of UrbanDaddy.com.\n\nSara has lived in Miami for five years and says the city has a vibrant arts scene.\n\nCNN: What made you start blogging the city?\n\nSara: When I moved down here I realized there was so much more to the city than just the beach and the hotels.\n\nThere were lots of extravagant condo-building parties at the time -- the type where you\'d go to the construction site, because the building was still in the planning stages, and they\'d throw this lavish catered party with open bar and feather dancers in an effort to get people to buy units. We were going to at least three of these events a week and I felt the need to document it.\n\nSo my blog started out as kind of a nightlife, event-driven blog and eventually became a chronicle of my adventures in the city, focused now mostly on my eating adventures.\n\nCNN: What makes Miami so special to you?\n\nSara: I think Miami is a place of unbridled optimism. It\'s also a place of great opportunity. There\'s lots of room here for entrepreneurial spirit and it\'s very much encouraged and appreciated. Just look at how much the city has changed in five years, in terms of the revival of Downtown and the Design District, and the thriving art scene. It\'s a place that is still evolving identity-wise and I\'m excited to be a part of it.\n\nCNN: Is there anything you dislike about the city?\n\nSara: The seasonal aspect of the city can be frustrating -- the way it shuts down in the summer and then revs up in the winter.\n\nAlso, the crowding in the winter, when all the seasonal residents come back and suddenly there are no parking spaces, the lines at the grocery store are horrendous and you realize you\'re trying to live in a tourist Mecca and get your errands done when everyone around you is vacationing. Oh and the drivers -- possibly the worst driving etiquette in the country.\n\nCNN: Is Miami just about the sun and sand, or is there more to it?\n\nSara: There\'s definitely more to this city than the tropical getaway. There\'s a vibrant art scene, where each month the gallery district is alive with opening receptions and throngs of people interested in getting out and seeing the scene. There\'s also the internationally renowned Art Basel art fair that comes to town every year putting Miami on the cultural map.\n\nAlso, food-wise there\'s lots of exciting things going on, from an incredibly diverse selection of Latin cuisine. Everything from Argentinean to Venezuelan food, to Haitian, to Caribbean -- there\'s a ton of great ethnic food here. There\'s also a growing high-end dining scene, where a lot of the national trends, like organic, locally sourced cooking, are happening on a very high level.\n\nCNN: Could you describe a typical Miamian\'s weekend?\n\nSara: A typical weekend would probably entail going to dinner in the Design District on Friday night, going for a walk or a bike ride along the beach on Saturday morning, then lunch on Lincoln Road. Saturday night there are usually some great DJs in town, so it\'s worth checking out the Downtown club scene, or if it\'s Art Walk, the galleries in Wynwood.\n\nSunday is spent perusing farmers markets, which are popping up in most neighborhoods, and lazily reading the paper over brunch. Sunday night is always bingo at the Standard hotel, a hipster hangout.\n\nCNN: Where do you shop?\n\nSara: I usually head to the Aventura Mall if I\'m looking to hit a bunch of stores in one fix. There\'s Bloomingdales, Urban Outfitters and your typical mall stores, like Banana Republic, etc. Collins Avenue in South Beach between 10th and 6th is good for Barney\'s Co-op (where there\'s always a sale), Intermix and the Webster.\n\nCNN: If Miami was a person, what would she or he be like?\n\nSara: Attractive, laid back and stylish.

{'text': '(CNN)  -- The man arrested for the videotaped rape of a toddler in Las Vegas, Nevada, will make his initial appearance in court Friday, a Clark County, Nevada, court official told CNN Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities have not yet decided if Chester Arthur Stiles will appear in person or via video link. The judge will set a date for the arraignment at that hearing.\n\nStiles, 37, was taken into custody Monday night after a Henderson, Nevada, police officer pulled over the white Buick Century he was driving.\n\nA former girlfriend of Stiles\' said that, before the arrest, she lived in fear after going to police to identify the suspect after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news.\n\n"I\'ve had my share of nightmares," Elaine Thomas told CNN\'s Nancy Grace.\n\nThomas said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television and had no choice but to contact police about the man she had thought was a "weapons enthusiast" with only a minor criminal record.  Watch Thomas say how she felt when she saw the photos »\n\n"How could I not tell them who that man was? That little girl suffered unimaginable things, and I knew for a fact it was him," Thomas said.\n\nThe judge in the case will hold an administrative hearing Wednesday, but Stiles will not be present, Clark County court spokesman Michael Sommermeyer said.\n\nStiles was already being sought on an unrelated 2004 charge of felony lewdness with a child under 14, Sommermeyer said, adding that authorities amended that earlier filing on October 4 to include 20 counts related to the videotaped rape, including sexual assault and attempted sexual assault.\n\nJerry T. Donohue, the attorney for the girl\'s mother, told CNN that the child on the videotape was younger than 3 when the abuse occurred.\n\nHenderson Police Officer Mike Dye said he pulled over Stiles\' car Monday night because it did not have a license plate and became suspicious when the driver gave him an expired California driver\'s license with a photo that did not look like him.\n\nDye said he and another officer, Mike Gower, questioned Stiles until he admitted his identity.\n\n"He finally told us, \'Hey, I\'m Chester Stiles. I\'m the guy you\'re looking for,\'" Dye said. "At that time, he said, \'I\'m sick of running.\'"\n\nDye said Stiles was calm and cooperative.\n\nStiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was turned over to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police and booked into the jail in Clark County, where he had been sought in connection with the videotape, which shows a girl being sexually assaulted.\n\nThe girl, who is now 7, was found last month after a nationwide search.\n\nThe tape was given to authorities by Darren Tuck, who told police he had found it in the desert five months before handing it over. Because of the delay, during which Tuck allegedly showed the tape to others, he faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography.\n\nHe turned himself in to authorities in Nye County, Nevada, earlier this month.\n\nProfessionals have evaluated the girl in the videotape since she was found, and she appears to be "healthy and fine and happy," her mother\'s attorney said this month.\n\nThe mother had not known her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until late last month, Donohue said.\n\n"A family friend called her and said, \'My God, you need to turn on the TV. I believe that is your daughter,\' " Donohue said.\n\nDonohue said the mother recognized Stiles, a former animal trainer.\n\nThe alleged abuse most likely occurred while the mother -- a single woman working six days a week -- was at work, Donohue said.\n\nAnother former girlfriend of Stiles\', Tina Allen, said this month she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is "mortified" by the allegations against him.\n\n"He said he\'d been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be," Allen said.\n\nAllen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived.\n\nAlso living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, the alleged assault victim.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A British-owned cargo ship on Monday became the latest vessel to be seized by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden.\n\nInternational naval patrols have been stepped up in the Gulf of Aden following increased pirate attacks.\n\nThe 32,000-tonne Malaspina Castle was taken early on Monday and was believed to be heading towards Somalia\'s pirate-infested coast, the European Union\'s Horn of Africa maritime security center said.\n\n"Few details are known at this stage, but the mixed-nationality crew is believed to be safe," a statement on the London-based organization\'s Web site said.\n\nThe vessel, which is operated by an Italian company, carried a crew of 24, from Bulgaria, Ukraine, Russia and the Philippines, Britain\'s Telegraph newspaper reported.\n\n"There have not yet been communications from the Malaspina Castle that we are aware of, so information is limited," said Andrew Mwangura of the Seafarers\' Assistance Program in quotes carried by the Telegraph.\n\nHe added: "It is likely to be taken towards the Somali coast and negotiations will begin soon."\n\nMeanwhile, the BBC reported that a Taiwanese fishing boat, with a crew of 29, was also hijacked Monday approximately 260km (160 miles) from the Seychelles.\n\nThe latest attacks follow a string of incidents in the pirate-plagued waterway off Somalia at the weekend, with a French yacht, a Yemeni tugboat and a German ship also reported to have been seized.\n\nLast year, pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 off Somalia, according to the International Maritime Bureau.\n\nIn response, a number of countries have deployed warships from their navies to the region, including the United States, China and Japan.\n\nMonday\'s seizure of the Malaspina Castle was immediately condemned by the UK ship masters\' union Nautilus, which has long urged governments to take stronger action to deter piracy.\n\nNautilus assistant general secretary Mark Dickinson told the British Press Association: "Over the last 10 years, most governments have not really done very much about this.\n\n"More recently they have been motivated to act and there is an EU naval coordination force patrolling off the Gulf of Aden."\n\nHe added: "I\'m not sure that this is going to be a long-term thing and I\'m also worried that the pirates will start seizing ships well away from the areas being patrolled.\n\n"In Somalia, piracy is like a big, successful industry and the authorities there need to act. The pirates are treated like local heroes. People look up to them and girls want to marry them.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Neda Agha-Soltan: The night before she was killed on the streets of Tehran, the woman the world would come to know simply as Neda had a dream. "There was a war going on," she told her mother, Hajar Rostami, the next morning, "and I was in the front."\n\n\n\nNeda\'s mother had joined her in the street protests that erupted after Iran\'s disputed June 12 presidential election. But on that fateful morning, she told her daughter she couldn\'t go with her. As Neda prepared to leave, the mother told CNN last November, she was filled with anxiety. "I told her to be very careful, and she said she would."\n\n\n\nOn June 20, Neda, 26, headed to Tehran\'s Nilofar Square, where thousands of protesters gathered. Tear gas was lobbed at the crowd. Her eyes burning, Neda headed to a medical clinic to get them washed. Neda later walked toward her car, parked on a side street not far from the heated protests. A single bullet struck her chest, and Neda was dead.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Long Island University announced it was awarding a 2009 George Polk Award, one of journalism\'s highest honors, to the unknown videographer who captured Neda\'s final moments -- her collapse on the street and her death. The New York Times reports that this is the first time in the 61-year history of the prestigious awards that judges have given the honor to work done anonymously.\n\n\n\n"This video footage was seen by millions and became an iconic image of the Iranian resistance," John Darnton, curator of the Polk Awards, told the newspaper. "We don\'t know who took it or who uploaded it, but we do know it has news value. This award celebrates the fact that, in today\'s world, a brave bystander with a cellphone camera can use video-sharing and social networking sites to deliver news."\n\n\n\nThe New York Times: Polk award winners include anonymous video uploader\n\n\n\nGeorge Polk Awards in Journalism: 2009 winners\n\n\n\nCNN: Neda was \'like an angel,\' mother says\n\n\n\nWilliam Ward Warren: When President Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy arrived at Dallas Love Field on November 22, 1963, there were as many as 100 photographers there, mostly shooting black and white film. On Monday, the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in Dallas released never-before-seen, 8 mm amateur color film taken by Warren.\n\n\n\nAccording to a release by museum curator Gary Mack, Warren was 15 at the time of the assassination, and because students were given the day off for the president\'s visit, he took his camera to Love Field to watch the arrival of Air Force One.\n\n\n\n"My dad operated a furniture store adjacent to the airport, and so that morning on his way to work, he dropped me off at the airport to see [President Kennedy] come in," Warren said, according to the museum release. "It was cool and yet the sun was shining bright, and there was lots of excitement."\n\n\n\nKennedy was killed less than an hour after Warren captured the start of his visit to Texas.

She funded her "50 in 52 Journey" by draining her 401k -- the entire $31,000 -- and then asking others for donations.\n\n\n\nHer goal was to collect the stories of ordinary Americans who were making a difference in their local communities and to share those stories on her Web site. She ultimately interviewed more than 500 people, blogged regularly and posted 370 videos.\n\n\n\nIn January, she launched the Journey Institute, telling CNN on Monday, "One main thing I heard while traveling was, if they didn\'t have someone to push them or mentor them or train them, they wouldn\'t have been able to put their idea into action."\n\n\n\nSo after her journey, Michaelson decided to help people get their ideas off the couch and put them into action. Her plan is to bring people from every state facing similar challenges to Denver and give them training on how to solve those problems.\n\n\n\nMichaelson said, "No matter where I went, I met people who were the same as the pioneers who built this country. They not only had to build their barns and plant their fields, they had to help their neighbors do the same. The people I met had the same values as those pioneers."\n\n\n\n50 in 52 Journey Web site\n\n\n\nThe Denver Post: Woman travels nation, documents people making life better\n\n\n\nKim Jong Il: Tuesday is the "Dear Leader\'s" birthday, but where, do you ask, was he born in 1942? His official biography declares it was at the foothills of Mount Baekdu, North Korea\'s sacred mountain, amid bright lights and double rainbows. But historians are pretty sure he was born at a guerrilla base under Soviet protection in the Soviet Union. The discrepancy should not surprise. When Time magazine\'s Frances Romero wrote about the supreme leader of the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea, the profile began, "An easy way of summing up Kim\'s life in one sentence would be to throw in the words reportedly, allegedly and the occasional is said to."\n\n\n\nHis father, Kim Il Sung, founded North Korea, and his son ran the country more or less for 20 years as his father aged, taking power officially in 1997, a few years after his father\'s death. "Here\'s a guy who is very concerned about his physical stature, among other things," said Dr. Jerrold Post, a former CIA psychologist who heads the political psychology program at George Washington University. "He\'s 5-foot-2 and wears 4-inch lifts in his shoes."\n\n\n\nPost, in his book "Leaders and Their Followers in a Dangerous World," writes that Kim also loved to drink a certain Hennessy cognac that sold for $630 a bottle in Korea. Hennessy, the maker of Paradis cognac, confirmed that Kim was the biggest buyer of the cognac, and between 1988 and 1998, maintained an estimated annual account of $650,000 to $800,000.\n\n\n\nPost wrote the ruler "annually spent 770 times the income of the average North Korean citizen ($1,038) on cognac alone!" Post told CNN that Kim Jong Il once kidnapped the most prominent South Korean movie star and kept her under house arrest with her husband for eight years. And he has a collection of some 20,000 videotapes, including the complete James Bond movie collection.\n\n\n\nIn August 2008, Kim had a stroke and was out of view for some time, and now seems to have recovered. Post said he believes that some of his toughness on North Korean nuclear policy now may be the indication of a power struggle at the end of his rule.\n\n\n\nCNN: North Korea marks Kim Jong Il\'s birthday\n\n\n\nCNN: Mystery has surrounded Kim Jong Il\n\n\n\nTime: Two-minute bio: Kim Jong Il\n\n\n\nBode Miller: NBC Winter Games anchor Bob Costas said this weekend that the word "redemption" may be the most overused cliché in all of Olympics coverage, but it pretty much describes Bode Miller\'s downhill race Monday.\n\n\n\nSports Illustrated and the U.S. Ski Team Web site report that Miller, winner of 32 World Cup races, won two silver medals in Salt Lake City, Utah, but none during any of his five races at the Turin Olympics in in Italy in 2006. Then in May 2007, Miller announced he was leaving the U.S. Ski Team to race independently, only to rejoin the team in 2009.\n\n\n\nMonday in Vancouver, British Columbia, Miller won a bronze medal in the men\'s Olympic downhill, finishing behind Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, who took silver, and gold medal winner Didier Defago of Switzerland. Miller missed the gold by nine one-hundredths of a second, but he now holds the U.S. record for most medals in Alpine skiing.

{'text': '(CNN) -- In the three years since "Twilight" bowed in theaters, we\'ve learned a few things:\n\n\n\n\n\nOne, while teen girls are a sizable portion of the fan base, they\'re not its totality.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo, the first three films of the franchise have pulled in roughly $1.8 billion worldwide in ticket sales (not adjusted for inflation), according to BoxOfficeMojo.com. That\'s apparently enough for Robert Pattinson, who stars as Edward Cullen, to talk of being able to afford to fail, and his co-star Kristen Stewart (Bella Swan) of donating some of her "funds."\n\n\n\n\n\nThree, there must be a just a teeny tiny footnote on each installment\'s budget for Taylor Lautner\'s wardrobe, because rare is the moment when the kid isn\'t walking around without a shirt.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part I" opens in theaters today, we\'re recounting 10 other (tongue firmly in cheek) lessons we\'ve culled from the series, themes that have been carried from Stephenie Meyer\'s best-selling novels onto the big screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Love at first sight is overrated; he or she should fall for you at first whiff.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Edward Cullen got to know the human he eventually married, he smelled Bella from across the classroom.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, his senses are attuned to the scent of human blood, but you\'re missing the point: Bella\'s smelled special, like his "own personal brand of heroin," as he memorably says in the first film. Ladies and gents, rethink your relationships if they don\'t inspire comparisons to narcotics.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. "He\'s Just Not That Into You" had it all wrong -- silence, irritation, storming off and mood swings are actually signs of unexpressed affection.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdward Cullen wasn\'t always the sparkly dreamboat of a blood-drinking gentleman you\'ll see in theaters this weekend. At first, he was actually pretty rude, prone to angrily walking away from Bella, being short with her and repeatedly telling her to stay away from him because he\'s dangerous. Talk about mixed messages!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next time someone gives you the brush off, don\'t think he or she isn\'t into you. Perhaps they\'re just trying to refrain from going for that vein in your neck.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to our next lesson:\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Be accepting of your partner\'s eccentricities.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuirks such as eye color fluctuations, superhuman strength, the ability to read minds and family members who try to devour you on your birthday are qualities that make a partner unique. Don\'t let silly things like her predisposition to kill stand in the way -- every relationship has its obstacles! Just be glad she\'s not a zombie.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. There\'s no such thing as personal space when one\'s in love.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdward and Bella are so into each other, the thought of being separated for more than a span of a few days could send one of them into an outburst that rivals a demonic possession out of "The Exorcist." This was depicted with strong commitment from Kristen Stewart in 2008\'s "Twilight," as she made Bella appear to be on the verge of a stroke when Edward suggested they should maybe rethink this whole human/vampire relationship thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nReally, your partner only needs enough space to go to the bathroom and change clothes, and even then, you should be waiting for them on the other side of the door.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. In the event that you and your partner do breakup, withdrawing from life as you lived it while having hallucinations about your romantic partner are all expected side effects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\'s why they call it being lovesick, kids.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Since you can\'t control such emotions, one should be open to falling in love with a human, shapeshifter, immortal or a baby.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaylor Lautner\'s Jacob Black and other select members of his tribe have the ability to phase into wolves to protect their land, and they can also "imprint," essentially falling in love and linking themselves with the one person with whom they\'re supposed to be . They also can\'t help whom they "imprint" on.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if it happens that the woman of your dreams was born just a few days ago to the woman you used to have a crush on, well, you\'ll just have to wait.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. If one love interest is the fun one, and the other love interest brings the passion, just hang out with both for as long as possible. *\n\n\n\n\n\nCommitting to one person is a tough choice, especially when you could die just from hanging around said individual, so it\'s understandable if your affections get pulled in another direction during a vulnerable moment. The best thing to do is to maintain one as the "relationship" and the other as the "friendship" until you can\'t play that game anymore. Bonus if they\'re natural-born enemies.\n\n\n\n\n\n* Frankly, this lesson makes some sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. There\'s always going to be a rumble brewing, and one of you is always going to have to be saved.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdward and Bella are always fighting off this enemy or that, right up until the very end. Believe it or not, this kind of stress somehow benefits the relationship -- just think of all that drama as the"spark" that ignites the fire of romantic moments. You know, "It\'s us against the world/Volturi," etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n9. When given the option, go ahead and stay human for the honeymoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you\'re not breaking the bed while vacationing on your new spouse\'s private island, you\'re doing it wrong. Thankfully, there\'s hired help ready to clean it all up for you -- that\'s what happens when you wed an unbelievably wealthy immortal. But if you get pregnant, get ready for one hellish gestation period.\n\n\n\n\n\n10. One can both acknowledge the ridiculousness of lessons one through nine and still be in line for a midnight showing after reading the series (again).\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the biggest lesson of all? Don\'t look for nuggets of enlightenment in "Twilight." As fans of the series could tell you, the biggest draw isn\'t the outlandish plot points or the unrealistic romantic ideals, but the classic fantasy of love somehow conquering all.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave we missed a lesson you\'ve learned? We want to hear it in the comments.', 'qa': [{'question': 'Who stars in the movie?', 'answers': ['Robert Pattinson,']}, {'question': 'What opens in theaters?', 'answers': ['"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part I"', 'Part I"', '"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn']}]}

{'text': '(CNN) -- U.S. President George W. Bush on Tuesday will designate nine sites in three areas of the central Pacific as marine national monuments, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new designated areas make up the largest area of ocean set aside for marine conservation in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new areas make up the largest area of ocean set aside for marine conservation in the world -- 195,280 square miles -- and, coupled with a 138,000-square mile designation in Hawaii two years go, mean that Bush will have protected more of the ocean than any other president.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The president\'s actions will prevent the destruction and extraction of natural resources from these beautiful and biologically diverse areas without conflicting with our military\'s activities and freedom of navigation, which are vital to our national security," Perino said. "And the public and future generations will benefit from the science and knowledge gained from these areas."\n\n\n\n\n\nBush is using the 1906 Antiquities Act -- first used by President Theodore Roosevelt to set aside public lands such as the Grand Canyon as national monuments -- for the designation. Many of those lands later became national parks.\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Chandler, vice president for government affairs for the non-profit Marine Conservation Biology Institute (MCBI), said Bush is "to be commended" for his action.\n\n\n\n\n\n"From a conservation history perspective, the message here is that Teddy Roosevelt laid the groundwork for our national park system when he withdrew a lot of public lands and called them national monuments," said Chandler.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We see the president laying the foundation for a system of national marine preserves and parks," he said. "We had lacked such a system for a long time."\n\n\n\n\n\nMCBI and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) partnered to identify eight of the nine sites the president will set aside on Tuesday. All but one of those eight remote areas already have Fish and Wildlife Service refuge areas at their cores.\n\n\n\n\n\n"You have a core conservation mission already," Chandler said. "This is just basically going to expand them."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MCBI/EDF-identified sites are Rose Atoll, Wake Island, Johnston Island, Palmyra Island, Kingman Reef, Baker Island, Howland Island and Jarvis Island.\n\n\n\n\n\nRose Atoll, part of American Samoa, is the smallest atoll in the world, but more than 500 fish species swim in the waters around it, and it supports 97 percent of America Samoa\'s seabird population. It is also the nesting ground for several threatened turtle species.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pew Environmental Fund identified the ninth site -- the waters around the northern Marianas and the deepest ocean canyon in the world, the Mariana Trench, 11,033 meters (36,201 feet) at its deepest.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new designations will expand protection to a 50 nautical mile area off the islands, where commercial fishing will be prohibited. Other uses of the area -- research or recreational fishing -- will be allowed but will require a permit.\n\n\n\n\n\nBush has not gotten rave reviews for his conservation efforts on land -- according to the Audubon Society, he\'s signed wilderness legislation covering a little more than 2 million acres, fewer than any other president except Richard Nixon. But Chandler said that Bush "has really embraced ocean conservation as his own."\n\n\n\n\n\n"Ocean protection ... is lagging 50 to 100 years behind land conservation, he said. "This is precisely the kind of leadership that we need to get the message across that there are places in the ocean that are rich with diversity."\n\n\n\n\n\n"Scientists already know this," he said. "They have been calling for this for 10 or 15 years."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president can cut through the bureaucracy that makes protecting resources such a lengthy process, and the Antiquities Act is a strong tool for those efforts. With the Act, the president can make a designation by executive order, essentially "writing the prescription for conservation" for an area, Chandler said.', 'qa': [{'question': 'The new areas cover how many square miles?', 'answers': ['195,280']}, {'question': 'What did the sites include?', 'answers': ['Rose Atoll, Wake Island, Johnston Island, Palmyra Island, Kingman Reef, Baker Island, Howland Island and Jarvis Island.']}, {'question': 'How many nautical miles will be protected?', 'answers': ['50']}, {'question': 'What did Bush designate?', 'answers': ['nine sites in three areas of the central', 'Pacific as marine national monuments,']}, {'question': 'Who designated the marine national monuments?', 'answers': ['President George W.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A lawyer who left a videotape saying Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom would be responsible if anything happened to him masterminded his own death last year, a special United Nations commission said Tuesday after an eight-month investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nColom had nothing to do with the killing, said Carlos Castresana, head of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Rodrigo Rosenberg, for some reason, decided to put an end to his life," Castresana said at a televised news conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nRosenberg was shot from behind in a brazen daylight attack while riding his bicycle in Guatemala City, the nation\'s capital. He was shot three times in the head, once in the neck and once in the back, Castresana said.\n\n\n\n\n\nProminent Guatemalan brothers Francisco Jose Valdez Paiz and Jose Estuardo Valdez Paiz hired hit men at the behest of Rosenberg, who told them he was being threatened by someone, Castresana said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two brothers, who own a pharmaceutical company, had been cousins of Rosenberg through a previous marriage and did not know that he was the target of the assassination, Castresana said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRosenberg fed information to the hit squad leader that led to his own death, giving descriptions of what the target looked like and where he would be.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It was the two brothers and no one else," Castresana said. "Not a politician. Not a [government] minister. Not a police chief. No one. Just these two brothers."\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 300 investigators from 11 nations reached their conclusion after an exhaustive examination of 100,000 telephone calls, 9,500 documents, surveillance videotapes, and 135 interviews with 11 suspects and others, Castresana said.\n\n\n\n\n\nColom had maintained since the May 10 slaying that he was innocent despite Rosenberg\'s explosive videotape, which was made public the day after his death.\n\n\n\n\n\nGuatemalan authorities have arrested 11 men on suspicion that they carried out the killing, but the Valdez Paiz brothers remain at large.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir lawyer, Alexis Calderon, denied last week that his clients were involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n"This is a story being made up to implicate people who didn\'t have anything to do with it," Calderon said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also said that he did not know where the brothers were but that they would surrender after Tuesday\'s conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalderon did not answer calls seeking comment Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nArrest warrants for the brothers were issued December 10, Castresana said, noting that the suspects were already out of the country by then.\n\n\n\n\n\nRosenberg recorded the tape blaming Colom three days before his death.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said Colom wanted him dead because the lawyer had been blaming the president and some of his top associates for the slaying of a prominent businessman and his daughter the previous month.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusinessman Khalid Musa and his daughter, Marjorie, were killed, Rosenberg said, because they had refused to participate in acts of corruption as the president wanted.\n\n\n\n\n\nRosenberg was Musa\'s attorney.\n\n\n\n\n\nCastresana indicated Rosenberg staged his own killing to get back at Colom and high-level members of his government, whom he could not prove were responsible for the Musa killings.\n\n\n\n\n\n"He wanted to open a box of lightning and thunder," said Castresana, a Spanish judge.\n\n\n\n\n\nCastresana pointed to several indicators of Rosenberg\'s state of mind: His mother had died; he was going through a second divorce, and his wife had taken their young children to Mexico; he was bereft at the slaying of Marjorie Musa, with whom he had a close relationship; and he felt a sense of powerlessness because he could not prosecute the people he believed were responsible for the Musa slayings.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 10, the date of his killing, was Mother\'s Day.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn two April 21 e-mails, seven days after the Musa killings, Rosenberg wrote, "I can\'t stop crying" and "I feel like I\'m disintegrating," Castresana said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRosenberg made out his last will and testament on April 24 and started going public with his accusations against Colom regarding the Musa slayings on May 3.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn May 4, he called a meeting at his law office and said he would be leaving the firm, in which he was a partner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next day, Castresana said, Rosenberg asked a friend to buy two cell phones anonymously. Those cell phones, the lead investigator said, were crucial to cracking the case.\n\n\n\n\n\nRosenberg used one of the phones to call threats to his personal cell phone and had the other delivered to the Valdez Paiz brothers, who gave it to the hit squad leader. Rosenberg then used the new cell phone he kept to give instructions to the hit squad leader through the second phone, Castresana said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCastresana detailed how the slaying apparently was meant to be paid through a $40,000 check.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the investigator, Rosenberg told his secretary before his death that she would be receiving a check from Panama that should be delivered to the Valdez Paiz brothers. The check had been made out by Luis Alejos, a Rosenberg friend and business associate who at the time was Guatemala\'s minister of communication, Castresana said. Alejos resigned from office in June, a few weeks after the slaying.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter receiving the check, Francisco Jose Valdez Paiz destroyed it, Castresana said. The businessman paid the 300,000 quetzales ($35,900) for the assassination out of his own pocket, Castresana said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investigator said Rosenberg sent Alejos the money to pay for the killing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlejos is the brother of Roberto Alejos, the president of the Guatemalan Congress, and a cousin of Gustavo Alejos, who is President Colom\'s private secretary.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his videotape, Rosenberg said Gustavo Alejos would be among those responsible for the lawyer\'s death if it happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n"If you are reading this message, it means that I, Rodrigo Rosenberg Marzano, was murdered by the president\'s private secretary, Gustavo Alejos, and his associate Gregorio Valdez, with the approval of Mr. Alvaro Colom and [first lady] Sandra de Colom," Rosenberg said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the tape surfaced, Colom went on national TV with a vehement denial that he or anyone mentioned in the video was involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe expressed his sense of vindication in a televised speech Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I don\'t have any rancor in my heart," Colom said. "Just immense gratitude for those who waited patiently with us."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations established the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala in 2006 to investigate corruption and political violence. More than 200,000 people have been killed in the nation since 1970, mostly as a result of organized crime, drug-trade violence and a 36-year civil war that ended in 1996.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were 6,451 slayings in Guatemala last year, of which only 230 verdicts were achieved, Castresana said. That means, he said, that more than 96 percent of the killings in 2009 were not solved.', 'qa': [{'question': 'UN   commission included how many investigators?', 'answers': ['300']}, {'question': 'What did the lawyer leave?', 'answers': ['videotape', 'a videotape']}, {'question': 'what did the tape say?', 'answers': ['if anything happened to him', 'blaming Colom three days before his death.', 'the', 'Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom would be responsible']}, {'question': 'what is president expressing?', 'answers': ['his sense of vindication']}, {'question': 'how many investigators?', 'answers': ['About 300', '300']}, {'question': 'How many investigators were there?', 'answers': ['About 300']}, {'question': 'UN   commission is from how many nations?', 'answers': ['11']}, {'question': 'Who felt vindicated?', 'answers': ['Colom', 'Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom']}]}

The result is down to the efforts of all our people, who never give up.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Now we have to continue working like this, to improve the car so that it is competitive at all the circuits we will encounter."\n\n\n\n\n\nFerrari fined as Alonso denies Massa in Hockenheim controversy\n\n\n\n\n\nMontezemolo said the move was common practice within the Italian team.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I simply reaffirm what I have always maintained, which is that our drivers are very well aware, and it is something they have to stick to, that if one races for Ferrari, then the interests of the team come before those of the individual," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"In any case, these things have happened since the days of [1930s driver Tazio] Nuvolari, and I experienced it myself when I was sporting director, in the days of Niki Lauda and not just then."\n\n\n\n\n\nAlonso\'s win put the two-time world champion back into contention for this year\'s title.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 29-year-old is now within 34 points of championship leader Lewis Hamilton of McLaren while Massa, who finished second on Sunday, remains eighth with eight races left.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlonso, who also won in Bahrain, secured his second win of the F1 calendar after Massa let him pass shortly after receiving a coded message by race engineer Rob Smedley via his car radio.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmedley was heard saying to Massa: "Alonso is faster than you.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Perhaps it really WAS destiny.\n\n"Slumdog Millionaire," the little film that overcame tremendous odds simply to earn an American release, won eight Oscars Sunday night at the 81st annual Academy Awards, including best picture.\n\n"Most of all we had passion and we had belief, and our film shows if you have those two things, you have everything," said producer Christian Colson, surrounded by many members of the film\'s huge cast and crew.\n\nIt was a supremely unlikely success story. "Millionaire," which combines elements of Bollywood melodrama and documentary grit, features no stars.\n\nIt\'s set largely among the poverty-stricken districts of Mumbai, India, and one-third of the film is in Hindi. Its initially reluctant director, Danny Boyle, is better known for brash British films such as "Trainspotting" and "28 Days Later." And the film almost went straight to DVD in America, thanks to the folding of initial studio Warner Independent Pictures (like CNN, it\'s a unit of Time Warner).\n\nBut the film\'s orphaned, poverty-raised hero, played by Dev Patel, overcomes his challenges to earn a spot on the game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" -- not necessarily to win money, but to connect with his lost love. On the show, he\'s told that perhaps he is a figure of destiny.\n\n"It is written," the show\'s smarmy host tells him, somewhat mockingly, after Patel\'s character aces several questions. List of winners, nominees\n\n"Slumdog\'s" filmmakers were jubilant at the wins, which also included Oscars for best director (Boyle), best adapted screenplay (Simon Beaufoy), score (A.R. Rahman), cinematography (Anthony Dod Mantle), song, sound mixing and film editing.\n\nBoyle jumped up and down as he accepted his award, saying he\'d told his children that if he ever won, he\'d bounce like Tigger from "Winnie-the-Pooh."\n\nRahman was equally appreciative.\n\n"All my life I\'ve had a choice between hate and love, and I chose love, and now I\'m here," he said.  Gallery: See what the stars are wearing »\n\n"Slumdog\'s" main competition, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," won just three Oscars, all in minor categories. The film had led the pack with 13 nominations.\n\nThe rest of the Oscar broadcast alternated between host Hugh Jackman\'s smooth song-and-dance numbers, some comic moments from Steve Martin, Tina Fey and Ben Stiller, and politics, generally focused on gay rights and California\'s anti-gay marriage Proposition 8.\n\nSean Penn won best actor for playing Harvey Milk in "Milk," the story of the first openly gay man elected to major public office. Penn earned laughs and applause for his speech. iReport.com: What do you think of the winners?\n\n"You commie homo-loving sons of guns," the sometimes truculent actor began, to laughter. "I did not expect this, and I wanted to be very clear that I do know how hard I make it to appreciate me, often. But I am touched by the appreciation."\n\nAfter a series of thank-you\'s, he turned serious in talking about gay marriage. "For those who saw the signs of hatred as our cars drove in tonight, I think it\'s a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect on their great shame and their shame in their grandchildren\'s eyes if they continue that support," Penn said. "We\'ve got to have equal rights for everyone."\n\nDustin Lance Black, who won original screenplay for "Milk," also gave an impassioned speech in favor of gay rights.\n\n"I think [Milk] would want me to say to all the gay and lesbian kids out there tonight ... that you are beautiful, wonderful creatures of value, and that no matter what anyone tells you, God does love you and that very soon, I promise you, you will have equal rights, federally, across this great nation of ours."\n\nHeath Ledger won best supporting actor for his performance as the Joker in "The Dark Knight." His parents and sister accepted the award for the actor, who died in January 2008.\n\n"This award tonight would have humbly validated Heath\'s quiet determination to be truly accepted by you all here -- his peers -- within an industry he truly loved," said Ledger\'s father, Kim.\n\nLedger is only the second actor to win a posthumous actor. Peter Finch won best actor for 1976\'s "Network" two months after he died in early 1977.\n\nOther winners included Kate Winslet, who won best actress for her performance in "The Reader"; Penelope Cruz, who won best supporting actress honor for "Vicky Cristina Barcelona"; and "WALL-E," which won best animated feature.\n\nMost of the winners, if not foreordained, were expected. The evening\'s sole shock came with best foreign-language film, which went to the Japanese film "Departures." Among the films it beat were France\'s "The Class" and Israel\'s "Dances With Bashir," two of the best-reviewed films of the year.\n\nThe Oscars moved at a steady pace, largely thanks to Jackman\'s brisk, jokey work. Only the introductions to the four acting categories, in which previous winners read tributes to current nominees as if they were about to appear on "This Is Your Life," considerably slowed the show, which ran close to three and a half hours.\n\nAt various points, Jackman cracked wise about downsizing -- "Next year," said the "Australia" star, "I\'ll be starring in a movie called \'New Zealand\' " -- performed songs about each best picture nominee in various musical styles, and paid tribute to various celebrities as if pointing out VIPs in a nightclub. He even physically carried Anne Hathaway on stage to play Richard Nixon in a "Frost/Nixon" send-up. Blog: Behind the scenes\n\nBut it was "Slumdog Millionaire" that carried the evening. At one point, Resul Pookutty, who won for sound mixing, seemed overwhelmed as he accepted his Oscar.\n\n"I dedicate this award to my country," he said. "Thank you, Academy, this is not just a sound award, this is history being handed over to me."\n\nGiven the import of East meeting West, the movie business can say the same thing.', 'qa': [{'question': 'Who is Heath Ledger?', 'answers': ['actor,', 'Joker in "The Dark Knight."']}, {'question': 'What is the name of the winner for best actor?', 'answers': ['Sean Penn', 'Dev Patel,']}, {'question': 'Who is Sean Penn?', 'answers': ['Harvey Milk', 'won best actor for playing Harvey Milk in "Milk,"', 'won best actor', 'actor']}, {'question': 'when Kate Winslet wins best actress for "The Reader"?', 'answers': ['Sunday night at the 81st annual Academy Awards,']}, {'question': 'who is Kate Winslet?', 'answers': ['actress', 'won best actress for her performance in "The Reader";']}, {'question': 'How many Oscars did the movie win?', 'answers': ['eight']}, {'question': 'what "Slumdog Millionaire" wins eight Oscars?', 'answers': ['the little film', 'the', 'won', 'Sunday night at the 81st annual Academy Awards, including best picture.', 'film', 'Millionaire," the little film that overcame tremendous', 'Sunday night', 'odds simply to earn an American release, won']}, {'question': 'What is the name of the winner for Best Actress?', 'answers': ['Kate Winslet,']}]}

The men tied up the three security guards and duct-taped their mouths, he said.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Pakistan\'s former president said his country is being treated "unequally" to other countries, despite being a staunch ally of the United States in its war on terror.\n\nFormer Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf says anti-American sentiment in Pakistan is high.\n\n"Pakistan is being treated so unequally while we are the ones who are in the lead role fighting the global war on terror," said Pervez Musharraf, interviewed by CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer for "The Situation Room."\n\n"This is what hurts Pakistan. It hurts the leadership. Indeed, it hurts the government. It hurts the people of Pakistan," said Musharraf, speaking from Dallas, Texas, during a book tour in the United States.\n\nThe interview took place amid reports Friday of U.S. drones striking militant targets in Pakistan just days after the start of the Obama administration -- which has made combating al Qaeda and Taliban militants in the Pakistan tribal region near Afghanistan its most immediate national security priority.\n\nMusharraf was asked whether he is comfortable with the continuation of the attacks, even with a new U.S. president in place.\n\n"Nobody in Pakistan is comfortable with the strikes across the border. There is no doubt in that. Public opinion is very much against it," he said. "But as far as this issue of the new president -- President Obama having taken over and this continuing -- but I have always been saying that policies don\'t change with personalities; policies have national interest, and policies depend on an environment.\n\n"So the environment and national interest of the United States being the same, I thought policies will remain constant," he said.

Musharraf said the 1989 "peace dividend" went to Europe -- East Europe.\n\nPakistan was "left alone" from 1989 to 2001, and during that period, the militant Taliban movement took control of Afghanistan.\n\n"What did Pakistan get out of fighting for 10 years with you? Nothing, sir," he said, explaining why public opinion in Pakistan has been "so much against the United States."\n\nMusharraf said public opinion in his country is strongly against strikes by U.S. drones against militants in the Pakistani tribal region.\n\nWhile al Qaeda and the Taliban must be confronted, he said, "public opinion is certainly against the methodology being adopted."

{'text': 'LONDON, England (CNN) -- Israeli military action in Gaza is comparable to that of German soldiers during the Holocaust, a Jewish UK lawmaker whose family suffered at the hands of the Nazis has claimed.\n\n\n\nA protester confronts police in London last weekend at a demonstration against Israeli action in Gaza.\n\n\n\nGerald Kaufman, a member of the UK\'s ruling Labour Party, also called for an arms embargo on Israel, currently fighting militant Palestinian group Hamas, during the debate in the British parliament Thursday.\n\n\n\n"My grandmother was ill in bed when the Nazis came to her home town of Staszow. A German soldier shot her dead in her bed," said Kaufman, who added that he had friends and family in Israel and had been there "more times than I can count."\n\n\n\n"My grandmother did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza."\n\n\n\nKaufman, a senior Labour politician who was raised as an Orthodox Jew, has often opposed Israeli policy throughout his career.\n\n\n\nIsrael has said it initiated the operation into Gaza -- which is controlled by Hamas -- to stop rocket fire on its southern cities and towns. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, have died in the operation in Gaza and from rocket strikes on southern Israel, according to the Israeli military.\n\n\n\nMore than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed, including many civilians, Palestinian medics said.\n\n\n\nDuring Thursday\'s debate, Kaufman also said that Israel needed to seek real peace and not peace by conquest, which would be impossible.\n\n\n\nHe also accused the Israeli government of "ruthlessly and cynically exploiting the continuing guilt from gentiles over the slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust as justification for their murder of Palestinians."\n\n\n\nBut Kaufman added that while it is necessary to talk to Hamas, which had been chosen by an electorate, it nevertheless is a "deeply nasty organization."\n\n\n\nBill Rammell, the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, said the UK government backed an EU presidency statement calling Israeli action disproportionate. But he also criticized Hamas rocket attacks on Israel during the cease-fire between June and December 2008, adding that the militant group\'s "whole ethos is one of violence" and that it had "made a brutal choice to step up attacks against innocent civilians."\n\n\n\n"Nothing, not the restrictions on Gaza nor its frustration with the peace process, justifies what Hamas has done and continues to do," Rammell said. "In December, I was in Ashkelon near the Gaza border, and I heard the sirens. The fear was palpable: This is daily psychological and actual warfare."\n\n\n\nRammell added that Hamas has "committed acts of terrorism, it is committed to the obliteration of the state of Israel, and its statement last week that it was legitimate to kill Jewish children anywhere in the world was utterly chilling and beyond any kind of civilised, humanitarian norm."\n\n\n\nThe debate came on the day that Saeed Siam, Hamas\' third-ranking leader in the territory, was killed by an Israeli airstrike, the Islamic militant group reported.\n\n\n\nThe United Nations\' main relief compound in the territory was also hit and set on fire, which U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon blamed on Israel.\n\n\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed sorrow over the incident but said Israeli forces were responding to militant fire near the complex.\n\n\n\nUK Prime Minister Gordon Brown described the shelling of the compound  as "indefensible," media agencies reported.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to Ban during a call, Brown said the UK would increase its calls for a cease-fire and also deliver aid to Gaza once a cease-fire took hold.\n\n\n\nBritain has witnessed several demonstrations since the conflict in Gaza began late last month.\n\n\n\nLast Saturday, up to 20,000 people gathered outside the Israeli Embassy in London, Metropolitan Police said.\n\n\n\nLater, parts of the crowd began pelting officers with sticks, rocks and pieces of metal barriers, police said.

{'text': 'EL PASO, Texas (CNN) -- Sitting in high school, math and history lessons never captured Danny Santos\' imagination. The drug-fueled streets of the Texas-Mexico border provided his education, and he was an excellent student.\n\n\n\nDanny Santos, 21, works two part-time jobs and still doesn\'t make as much as he did as a drug mule.\n\n\n\nSantos says he became one of the thousands of American and Mexican teenagers recruited into the dangerous world of drug smuggling.\n\n\n\n"I didn\'t care. I had no conscience," Santos said at a boxing gym in El Paso, Texas. "You\'re young, and you\'re naïve, and you think it\'s easy."\n\n\n\nSantos\' journey into the underworld of teenage drug smuggling offers a glimpse into how drug cartels lure teenagers into doing their dirty work.\n\n\n\nUS. Customs and Border Protection officials in El Paso and San Diego report that in recent months, they\'ve seen a rise in the number of juvenile drug smugglers getting busted at border checkpoints.\n\n\n\nThey\'re often called mules. These teenagers are usually hired only to smuggle drug loads across the border. It\'s a short drive or walk that offers quick cash but can carry serious consequences.  Watch how teens get drugs across the border »\n\n\n\nDrug cartels "just need someone who can legitimately cross the border," said Bill Molaski, the El Paso Port Director for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\n\n\nAs an American, Santos could freely cross the El Paso-Juarez border and not raise suspicion. At age 15, Santos says, he met "a guy" at a party who introduced him to drug kingpins in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.\n\n\n\n"You start off as a driver," Santos said. "People feel like they can trust you, then you move up to something bigger."\n\n\n\nTwo weeks later, he got a $4,000 job offer to drive his first load of marijuana across a bridge into El Paso. It was the beginning of a four-year smuggling career.\n\n\n\n"I can\'t say I wasn\'t nervous," Santos said. "You kind of project yourself into another time of happiness or joy. ... You just have to forget you have something illegal in the car."\n\n\n\nIn all, Santos says, he earned $50,000 making about 20 mule runs, driving right through heavily guarded border checkpoints.\n\n\n\nSantos, who is now 21, says he was arrested once but spent only a few days in jail. He said charges were dropped. Because he was younger than 18 when he was arrested, and juvenile cases are sealed, CNN could not confirm his story through court records.\n\n\n\nYoung smugglers don\'t fit a stereotype. Several sources said that both American and Mexican teens are lured into the work. Teenage boys and girls alike are involved. Many smugglers come from middle-class families.\n\n\n\n"There\'s a lot of money in the trade, a lot of inducement for a lot of young people to get involved," El Paso County Attorney Jose Rodriguez said.

Depending on the size of the drug load that\'s being smuggled, a kid can be paid a couple hundred dollars up to $5,000.\n\n\n\nMexican officials say cartels have placed classified advertisements in Mexican newspapers with cryptic messages offering young people a job with good salary and benefits.

Pfizer was not immediately available for comment.\n\n\n\nPfizer, the world\'s leading drugmaker in terms of sales, has been in talks to buy Wyeth. Pfizer\'s stock slipped 1 percent on the news Friday, while Wyeth gained about 8 percent.\n\n\n\nOn January 13 Pfizer said it was cutting up to 8 percent of its R&D staff, about 800 jobs. Spokesman Raymond Kerins said that was to "raise productivity."\n\n\n\nBut analysts say Pfizer is clearly trying to beef up its drug pipeline through an acquisition, adding that the company seems to have given up on its own R&D staff coming up with a blockbuster to replace Lipitor. This cholesterol-cutting drug peaked in 2006 with nearly $13 billion in annual sales but will lose its patent protection in 2011, when generic versions will become available.\n\n\n\nLes Funtleyder, pharma analyst for Miller Tabak, said Pfizer is "not feeling that they\'re getting the efficiency out of their R&D unit." He said Pfizer would probably rather do a deal with Wyeth over other competitors, because there is less overlap in the companies\' pipelines.\n\n\n\nFuntleyder said Pfizer already has a diabetes franchise, which would overlap with Eli Lilly & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb, both of which also focus on diabetes treatments. Pfizer probably has its eyes on Wyeth\'s Alzheimer\'s drug pipeline, he said. But he cautions that a merger won\'t be a success unless Wyeth\'s pipeline is successful, which remains to be seen, he said.\n\n\n\n"If Wyeth comes out with an Alzheimer\'s drug that works, then the deal works," he said.\n\n\n\nPfizer is probably also focused on Wyeth\'s blockbuster children\'s vaccine Prevnar, as well as its experimental biotech drugs, said Michael Krensavage of Krensavage Asset Management.\n\n\n\nSales of Prevnar, which combats meningitis and blood infections, jumped 12 percent in the first nine months of 2008 compared with the same period the prior year, to $2.1 billion.\n\n\n\nIf a deal does go through, Funtleyder warns, Wyeth staffers should brace for layoffs.\n\n\n\n"I can say with pretty good confidence that this is going to lead to some head count reduction," he said.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What did the rep say?', 'answers': ['"I can', 'with pretty good confidence that this is going to lead to some head count reduction,"', '"It is our policy not to comment on rumor or speculation,"', 'not to comment on rumor or speculation,"']}, {'question': 'How many jobs are being cut?', 'answers': ['800']}, {'question': 'Which department is having staff cut?', 'answers': ['R&D', 'cutting up to 8 percent of its R&D', 'Pfizer said it was cutting up to 8 percent of its R&D']}, {'question': 'What are the rumors about Wyeth?', 'answers': ['for $68 billion,', 'Pfizer is near a deal to buy rival drugmaker']}, {'question': 'What did Pfizer say?', 'answers': ['"raise productivity."']}, {'question': "Who said it's not their policy to comment on rumors?", 'answers': ['Michael Lampe, a Wyeth representative.']}, {'question': 'Who was not immediately available?', 'answers': ['Pfizer']}, {'question': 'What kind of company is Wyeth?', 'answers': ['drugmaker']}, {'question': 'What did the Wyeth rep say?', 'answers': ['"It is our policy not to comment on rumor or speculation,"']}, {'question': 'Number of jobs Pfizer was cutting?', 'answers': ['up to', 'said it', 'about 800', '800']}, {'question': 'Who was not available for comment?', 'answers': ['Pfizer']}, {'question': 'What would Pfizer be commenting on?', 'answers': ['cutting up to 8 percent of its R&D staff,', 'a deal to buy rival drugmaker Wyeth', 'buy rival drugmaker Wyeth', 'focused', 'is probably', "Wyeth's blockbuster children's vaccine Prevnar, as well as its experimental biotech drugs,"]}]}
{'text': 'NEW YORK (CNN) -- Consumer advocates Wednesday hailed the settlement of a class-action lawsuit over Sears stoves in which the retailer agreed to install safety brackets for free to prevent the appliances from tipping over or provide other reimbursements.\n\nStoves in danger of tipping over can be fixed for free under terms of a settlement announced Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the court-approved agreement, Sears will notify nearly 4 million customers who may have bought stoves between July 2000 and September 2007 that they either can get anti-tip safety brackets installed for free or receive gift cards or reimbursements of up to $100 to qualifying customers.\n\nThe brackets keep the appliances bolted to the floor or wall to prevent them from tipping over. Such accidents have caused more than 100 deaths or injuries, mostly from scalding and burns, according to the nonprofit consumer group Public Citizen.\n\nThe value of the settlement depends on how many customers respond to Sears\' offer, but Public Citizen said it could end up costing the retailer more than $545 million.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Retired Adm. William Fallon resigned in March as leader of the U.S. military\'s Central Command after reportedly clashing with President Bush.\n\n\n\nRetired Adm. William Fallon told CNN he resigned to maintain confidence in the military chain of command.\n\n\n\nDuring an interview Tuesday on CNN\'s American Morning," Fallon denied a magazine article\'s assertion that he had been forced to resign over his opposition to a possible war with Iran.\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Kyra Phillips asked Fallon about his resignation and about U.S. policy regarding Iraq and Iran.\n\n\n\nKyra Phillips: How were you informed that this was it? Who called you?\n\n\n\nFallon: The story is -- the facts are that the situation was one that was very uncomfortable for me and, I\'m sure, for the president. One of the most important things in the military is confidence in the chain of command. And the situation that developed was one of uncertainty and a feeling that maybe that I was disloyal to the president and that I might be trying to countermand his orders, the policies of the country. ... The fact that people might be concerned that I was not appropriately doing what I was supposed to do and following orders bothered me, and my sense was that the right thing to do was to offer my resignation.  Watch Fallon break his silence »\n\n\n\nPhillips: Do you feel you were pushed out?\n\n\n\nFallon: What was important was not me. It wasn\'t some discussion about where I was with issues. It was the fact that we have a war in progress. We had a couple of hundred thousand people whose lives were at stake out in Iraq and Afghanistan and we needed to be focused on that and not a discussion on me or what I might have said or thought or someone perceived I said. That\'s the motivation.\n\n\n\nPhillips: [Esquire magazine writer] Tom Barnett made it appear that you were the only man standing between the president and a war with Iran. Is that true?\n\n\n\nFallon: I don\'t believe for a second President Bush wants a war with Iran. The situation with Iran is very complex. People sometimes portray it or try to portray it in very simplistic terms -- we\'re against Iran, we want to go to war with Iran, we want to be close to them. ... The reality is in international politics that [there are] many aspects to many of these situations, and I believe in our relationship with Iran we need to be strong and firm and convey the principles on which this country stands and upon which our policies are based. At the same time demonstrate a willingness and openness to engage in dialogue because there are certainly things we can find in common.\n\n\n\nPhillips: Would have you negotiated with Iran?\n\n\n\nFallon: It\'s not my position to negotiate with Iran. I was the military commander in the Middle East. I had responsibility for our people and their safety and well-being. It\'s the role of the diplomats to do the negotiation.\n\n\n\nPhillips: So when talk of the third war came out, a war with Iran, the president didn\'t say to you, "This is what I want to do," and did you stand up and say, "No, sir. Bad move"?\n\n\n\nFallon: It\'s probably not appropriate to try to characterize it in that way. Again, don\'t believe for a second that the president really wants to go to war with Iran. We have a lot of things going on, and there are many other ways to solve problems. I was very open and candid in my advice. I\'m not shy. I will tell people, the leaders, what I think and offer my opinions on Iran and other things, and continue to do that.\n\n\n\nPhillips: Do you think that cost you your job?\n\n\n\nFallon: No, I don\'t believe so at all. It\'s a confidence issue of do people really believe the chain of command is working for them or do we have doubts, and if the doubts focus attention away from what the priority issues ought to be, then we\'ve got to make a change.\n\n\n\nPhillips: We talk about your no-nonsense talk and the fact that you had no problems standing up to the president. Your critics say that Admiral Fallon is a difficult man to get along with. Are you?\n\n\n\nFallon: You probably could ask my wife about that. She would have a few things to say.\n\n\n\nI think that what\'s really important here is that when I was asked to take this job about a year and a half ago, I believe it was because we were facing some very difficult days in Iraq and Afghanistan and in the region. I had some experience in dealing with international problems. I certainly had a lot of combat experience, and I was brought in in an attempt to make things better. That\'s what I went about doing.\n\n\n\nAgain, there are things that are important and other things in life that are less so. A lot of the issues that became points of discussion to me were not really important items. The important items were the people, what they\'re doing, how to get this job done, how to get the war ended and get our people home.\n\n\n\nPhillips: Hillary Clinton [and] Barack Obama talk about pulling troops out by next year. John McCain says, no, we\'ve got to stay the course. What is the best course for Iraq right now?  Watch what the candidates say about war policy »\n\n\n\nFallon: I believe the best course is to retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus and his team out there. Dave has done a magnificent job in leading our people in that country.\n\n\n\nAgain, this situation is quite complex -- many angles. There\'s a very, very important military role here in providing stability and security in this country, but that\'s not going to be successful, as we know, without lots of other people playing a hand.\n\n\n\nThe political side of things in Iraq has got to move forward. That appears to be improving. People have to have confidence in their futures. They want to have stability. They would like to be able to raise their families in peace. They would like to have a job. They would like to look to tomorrow as better than today.\n\n\n\nIt takes more than the military, but the military is essential to provide stability and security. The idea we would walk away from Iraq strikes me as not appropriate. We all want to bring our troops home. We want to have the majority of our people back and we want the war ended.\n\n\n\nGiven where we are today, the progress that they\'ve made particularly in the last couple months, I think it\'s very, very heartening to see what\'s really happened here.\n\n\n\nThe right course of action is to continue to work with the Iraqis and let them take over the majority of the tasks for ensuring security for the country and have our people come out on a timetable that\'s appropriate to conditions on the ground.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What is the best course in Iraq?', 'answers': ['to retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus and his team out there.', 'the', 'to retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus', 'is to retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus and his team out there.']}, {'question': 'Who is the General?', 'answers': ['Dave Petraeus']}, {'question': 'What did Fallon deny?', 'answers': ['Iran.', "article's assertion", 'he had been forced to resign over his opposition to a possible war with Iran.', 'resign', 'forced', 'opposition', 'possible war', "a magazine article's assertion that he had been forced to resign over his opposition to a possible war with Iran."]}, {'question': 'What is the best course for Iraq?', 'answers': ['General Dave Petraeus', 'high confidence', 'retain', 'to retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus and his team out there.', 'retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus']}, {'question': 'What led to the resignation?', 'answers': ['clashing with President Bush.']}, {'question': 'What led to resignation?', 'answers': ['reportedly clashing with President Bush.', 'clashing with President Bush.', 'Retired', 'after reportedly clashing with President Bush.', "Adm.

But it stipulates that the measure would not override existing U.S. trade treaties such as the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\n\n\nHarper said Canada\'s concerns about the clause are "important irritants ... but relatively small" when compared with the overall U.S.-Canadian trade relationship.', 'qa': [{'question': 'Who said there is no immediate plans for deployment?', 'answers': ['President Obama']}, {'question': 'How many troops does Canada have in Afghanistan?', 'answers': ['and NATO allies', 'another 35,000.', '35,000.', 'including']}, {'question': 'U.S. already planning to?', 'answers': ['economic stimulus package']}, {'question': 'How many more troops is the US planning to send?', 'answers': ['6,000']}, {'question': 'What are the plans of Obama after this deployment?', 'answers': ['allies before determining', 'would consult with', 'There are no immediate', 'to commit more U.S. troops to the ongoing war in Afghanistan,', 'said', 'strategy']}, {'question': 'How many troops are being send to Afghanistan this year?', 'answers': ['6,000', '62,000 U.S.']}]}

Now, world governments want him to act.\n\nThere are the apparently eternal conflicts of the Middle East and Kashmir, between India and Pakistan, that have already reared their ugly heads almost as a warning even before Obama took office. Between them, they engulf most of the grievances and violence that shape the Islamic world and its relations with the United States.\n\nIntense U.S. involvement will be needed to help resolve both of the conflicts. This will require imagination, creative out-of-the-box diplomacy, and the courage to see it through both from the United States and leaders on the ground. Going back even to the status-quo ante will no longer be sufficient.\n\nThe 30-year-old rupture in relations between the United States and Iran is also expected to be addressed as a key priority by the new administration. Both the president-elect and his secretary of state-designate have said they want to abandon the silent treatment and isolation of previous administrations and try engaging Iran, as a way of resolving difficult issues such as its nuclear program and its influence in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Watch Amanpour talk about world views of Obama »\n\nThe United States remains bogged down in hot wars in both of those countries. While the Obama administration plans to increase troops and nation-building in Afghanistan, it is also signaling it will not give President Hamid Karzai\'s government the "free ride" he is thought to have received from the Bush administration. Karzai will be expected to root out corruption and better address the needs of the Afghan people.\n\nThe new administration will also try to revive nuclear arms agreements that have been abandoned over the last eight years and try to forge a more constructive relationship with Russia, while persuading that country to meet its international obligations too.\n\nWhile many allies -- and adversaries -- welcome the new U.S. administration\'s declaration to use diplomacy and soft power, the question remains: Will Washington\'s allies also pull their weight in helping set their common agenda?\n\nMany nations and governments say they welcome America\'s vital global leadership, and the question at the start of the Obama administration is: Will they rise robustly to the occasion, and not just carp from the sidelines?

{'text': 'Baltimore, Maryland (CNN) -- President Obama and House GOP leaders promised greater efforts to step back from the partisan brink Friday, acknowledging that Washington\'s toxic political climate has made it increasingly tough to tackle major problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pledge was immediately called into question, however, as the two parties repeatedly expressed sharply differing viewpoints during a rare meeting at a House Republican retreat in Baltimore.\n\n\n\n\n\nObama accepted an invitation from House GOP leaders to address their caucus. His speech Friday was followed by an often pointed question-and-answer session.\n\n\n\n\n\n"House Republican leaders are grateful for [Obama\'s] willingness to come ... and have a frank and honest conversation," said Rep. Mike Pence, R-Indiana. "We welcome the dialogue with the president."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president accused Republicans of frequently mischaracterizing his policy proposals, particularly in the health care debate.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans, in turn, complained the White House and congressional Democrats had ignored their ideas, locked them out of the policy-making process and unfairly labeled them as obstructionists.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Both sides can take some blame for a sour climate on Capitol Hill," Obama said, adding that Democrats and Republicans need to be careful in choosing their rhetoric. "A ton of civility instead of slash and burn would be helpful."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president highlighted what he said was problematic GOP rhetoric on his health care proposals. Republicans, he said, had characterized the proposed program as some "kind of Bolshevik plot."\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, he said that much of his plan was similar to what Republicans had proposed during the failed Clinton-era push to overhaul health care.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth sides need to "close the gap a little bit between rhetoric and reality," the president argued. Calling his health care plan "some wild-eyed plot to impose big government in every aspect of our lives" leaves little room for bipartisan negotiation, Obama said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president questioned how Republicans could negotiate in good faith after using such rhetoric without exposing themselves to conservative primary challengers.\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he tried to be honest about differences over administration proposals.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I truly believe a government takeover of health care ... is the essence of their bill," Boehner said.\n\n\n\n\n\nObama conceded there\'s been a failure on his part to "try to foster better communications even if there\'s disagreement."\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has promised regular meetings with GOP leaders in the future. Boehner welcomed the gesture but said it is equally important for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to give Republicans a greater role in the legislative process.\n\n\n\n\n\nBipartisanship "isn\'t about taking one little Republican idea and throwing it in a 2,000-page bill," he said after Obama argued that Democratic leaders had taken GOP proposals into account in the health care debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n"If you\'re really serious about building a bipartisan product ... you need to do it from the beginning."\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans criticized the president for failing to fulfill a promise to televise all the health care negotiations on C-SPAN. Obama called the criticism "legitimate" but noted the overwhelming majority of committee hearings on the legislation had been conducted in front of TV cameras.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the bills had cleared the committees, however, it became a "messy process," he conceded.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I take responsibility for not having structured it in a way where it was all taking place in one place that could be filmed," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nObama and Republicans strongly criticized each other on a range of issues tied to taxes and spending.\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP leaders said Obama\'s $862 billion stimulus plan had been ineffective and repeatedly urged the president to consider an across-the-board tax cut.\n\n\n\n\n\nObama said it would be wrong to slash taxes for the richest Americans or the banking sector in a weak economy. He also argued that the stimulus program had saved key jobs in GOP districts across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There is not a single person in here who, had it not been for what was in the stimulus package, wouldn\'t be going home to more teachers laid off, more firefighters laid off, more cops laid off," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The component parts of the Recovery Act are consistent" with what many Republicans say are important, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stimulus helped in terms of "rebuilding our infrastructure, tax cuts for families and businesses, and making sure that we were providing states and individuals some support when the roof was caving in."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president said he agrees with the GOP emphasis on fiscal responsibility but hinted that Republicans could do more to help control spending, including curtailing legislative earmark requests for their own districts.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also said he is willing to work with Republicans on the enactment of a line-item veto.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There\'s not a president out there that wouldn\'t like that," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite their disagreements, both sides agreed the day\'s dialogue was a step in the right direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I hope that the conversation we begin here doesn\'t end here, that we can continue our dialogue in the days ahead," Obama said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day "went very well," Boehner replied later. "There are issues we do agree on" and Republicans will work to find "common ground."\n\n\n\n\n\nWe should "set aside perhaps the things that the president believes in that we philosophically don\'t, but if there is some common ground we ought to go ahead forward with those," said Rep.

{'text': 'FARGO, North Dakota (CNN)  -- More than 1,000 volunteers rushed to fill sandbags early Wednesday as many in North Dakota tried to protect themselves from a historic floods that are expected to swamp the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Fargo resident surveys the sandbags outside his home, located about 15 feet from the Red River, on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven at 3:30 a.m., hundreds of volunteers packed into individual sandbagging centers, an organizer said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There have been so many volunteers that we had to turn people away," said Ryan McEwan, a supervisor at one volunteer coordinating center. "It is very busy. They are filling sandbags as fast as they can."\n\n\n\n\n\nFargo city officials estimated that as many as 10,000 volunteers have come forward since Sunday to aid in a sandbagging effort that\'s taken over North Dakota State University\'s central arena, the Fargodome, and to help build levees along the now closely watched Red River. See map of affected area »\n\n\n\n\n\nThat river posed the greatest risk of about eight rivers in the state that were at flood levels, emergency officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fear is that the Red River could overtake all previous records. As of Wednesday morning, the Red River ran at about 33 feet -- 15 feet above flood stage. A record level of 41.1 feet was set in 1897.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe record level of the river set in the April 1897 flood could be surpassed Friday, Cecily Fong of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services said Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 1,000 people were evacuated from an area near the city of Bismarck on Tuesday night as the Missouri River flooded, Rick Robinson of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services said Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent rain and blizzard conditions have swollen the rivers.\n\n\n\n\n\nGov. John Hoeven received word late Tuesday that North Dakota had received a presidential disaster declaration.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We\'ve had a severe winter and are experiencing significant flooding across the state, so we are grateful to receive this federal assistance as we continue the flood fight and recovery effort," Hoeven said. Under the declaration, the federal government will cover 75 percent of the costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We\'re concerned about the rise of the river and how fast it\'s coming up, so our concern is that we\'re going to hit 41 feet," Fargo Deputy Mayor Tim Mahoney said Tuesday, adding that the way the levees are currently set up, they would protect against overflow only up to 38 feet.\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials are guessing the Red River, which runs through the eastern parts of North and South Dakota, and western Minnesota, could crest in Fargo -- North Dakota\'s largest city, with about 99,200 residents -- anytime Friday or Saturday and that the water may linger at its crest height.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe city has canceled all trials scheduled in Fargo Municipal Court through April 2 because of the expected flooding, to allow all police officers to be available for possible emergencies, according to the city\'s Web site.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of late Tuesday, Fargo residents and out-of-town volunteers had filled more than 1 million sandbags out of the needed 2 million.

He says applications such as Chordica and Beatmaker allow him to compose material and provide instant accompaniment for those spontaneous moments when he feels the need for a good sing (during the interview, Go broke into song every five minutes).\n\n\n\nGo\'s gadget of choice even doubled as a "fifth member of the band" during his July performance in front of 70,000 at London\'s Wembley Stadium.

{'text': 'LONDON, England (CNN) -- The killer of "Harry Potter" actor Rob Knox has been given four life sentences and told he will be behind bars for at least 20 years.\n\n\n\nThe parents of Robert Knox read a statement outside the Old Bailey after Karl Bishop was found guilty of his murder.\n\n\n\nA judge at the Old Bailey court in central London sentenced 22-year-old Karl Bishop on Thursday, the day after he was convicted of the attack on Rob Knox and four of his friends in southeast London last May.\n\n\n\nBishop stabbed them 10 times in less than two minutes, the court heard.\n\n\n\nKnox, 18, had rushed out of the bar after he heard that Bishop had threatened his younger brother Jamie but he ended up being stabbed five times, once in a main artery. He died in hospital later that night.\n\n\n\nThe judge, Mr Justice Bean, told Bishop: "You are at present a highly dangerous man," the Press Association reported.\n\n\n\n"There is plainly a very significant risk to the public of serious harm caused by your committing further offences of violence.\n\n\n\n"Because you had threatened his younger brother, Rob Knox was among those who tried to disarm you. He paid for his bravery with his life.\n\n\n\n"The truth is that you simply could not care less whether you killed him or not. When you learned that you had killed Rob your only response was to say \'Yeah, sweet.\'"\n\n\n\nDays before the attack, the actor had finished filming on "Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince," due for international release in July, in which he played the role of Marcus Belby. He was set to reprise the part in future "Harry Potter" films.\n\n\n\nKnox\'s father Colin told mourners at his funeral, including co-star Rupert Grint, that his son had been "living the dream," PA said.\n\n\n\nThe Knox family left the court without commenting, but earlier Rob\'s mother Sally said of Bishop: "Once he\'s got his sentence and he\'s gone, I will not waste my time thinking about him.\n\n\n\n"I just think maybe somebody like him may have some kind of disturbed mind, which may not be due to the life he\'s had, it just may be something in him."\n\n\n\nKnife crime in Britain is a political hot topic due to a spate of recent killings of mainly young people in major cities.

{'text': 'NEW YORK (CNN)  -- One summer night in 2004, 3-year-old Riley Fox lay asleep on a couch not far from her 6-year-old brother on a chair in the living room. Their father was sleeping in a nearby bedroom.\n\n\n\nThe FBI joined the search for the killer of 3-year-old Riley Fox last month.\n\n\n\nJust before 8 a.m., Kevin Fox was awakened by his son. The boy told his father that Riley was missing from the sofa.\n\n\n\nFox searched for his daughter for 40 minutes inside and outside their Wilmington, Illinois, home and then called police, according to authorities. His wife, Melissa, was in Chicago participating in a charity walk, and when she found out, she rushed home.\n\n\n\nNearly 500 volunteers, along with police and family, searched for the little girl.\n\n\n\nHer body was found later that day in a river in Forked Creek, Illinois, just 4 miles from the family\'s home. She\'d been bound and gagged with duct tape, raped and drowned, according to the Will County Sheriff\'s Office and the coroner\'s report.\n\n\n\nIt was June 6, 2004, the start of a horrific ordeal for the family.\n\n\n\nFox was arrested and charged with the killing, only to be exonerated by DNA evidence.\n\n\n\nMore than five years later, authorities have yet to capture Riley\'s killer.\n\n\n\nKathleen Zellner, Fox\'s attorney, said that the crime scene was brutal and that the theory is that Riley was snatched from her home, sexually assaulted and then thrown from the bridge overlooking the river where she drowned. Because her hands were bound and her mouth covered with duct tape, she was unable to swim or save herself, Zellner said.\n\n\n\nAccording to Zellner, Fox says that the night his daughter disappeared, he had gone to a street fair while the children\'s grandparents looked after them. On his way home, about midnight, Fox picked up his two sleepy children from their grandparents and put them to bed in the living room of the 500-square-foot cement box family home. Riley often fell asleep on the sofa and her 6-year-old brother on the chair near her while watching TV, Zellner said.\n\n\n\nFox has said the front door was wide open when he awoke, Zellner said, as was the back door. He has said he locked the front door before he\'d gone to bed.\n\n\n\nThe back door\'s lock had been broken weeks ago; they typically propped a stack of laundry baskets against it to keep it shut. According to the family, those baskets had been removed and placed on top of the laundry machine by someone other than family members.\n\n\n\n"From the beginning, we believed that someone was already inside the house waiting when Kevin got home with the kids that night, " Melissa Fox said. "But it was clear that police were looking at Kevin suspiciously."\n\n\n\nIndeed, five months later, Will County sheriff\'s officers arrested and charged Kevin Fox with the sexual assault and murder of his daughter. Zellner says the arrest came after authorities coerced a confession from him after 14 hours of relentless questioning.\n\n\n\nFox spent eight months in jail, but DNA evidence from the rape kit conducted on Riley\'s body finally exonerated him. There was no semen found during the autopsy, Zellner says, but saliva of an unidentified male was found on the duct tape covering Riley\'s mouth and elsewhere on her body.\n\n\n\nIn late 2007, the family won a $15.5 million wrongful-arrest suit against the sheriff\'s detectives.\n\n\n\nThe Foxes believe that the perpetrator was someone in the community who had been watching and targeting their daughter for some time.\n\n\n\n"For weeks before her disappearance, I couldn\'t shake a feeling of uneasiness, strange noises at night outside our house, as if someone were lurking and watching us," Melissa Fox said.\n\n\n\nZellner believes that another big clue was a red car similar to a Chevrolet Cavalier parked outside the Fox home that night, before Kevin Fox and his children returned home.\n\n\n\n"It\'s only been in the last few weeks that investigators have actively begun pursuing this case again," Zellner said, "even though Kevin was cleared nearly four years ago."\n\n\n\nLast month, the FBI joined the investigation at the request of Will County State Attorney James Glasgow. FBI agents combed Riley\'s neighborhood and talked with neighbors and other potential witnesses.\n\n\n\n"The FBI is bringing unprecedented resources and expertise to this investigation," Glasgow said in a statement. "We cannot allow this horrific crime against an innocent child to remain unsolved."\n\n\n\nThe family is offering a $100,000 reward, and the FBI is offering $10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for Riley Fox\'s death.\n\n\n\nAnyone with more information is urged to call the FBI\'s Chicago office at 312-421-6700.', 'qa': [{'question': "What sort of evidence exonerated Riley's father?", 'answers': ['DNA']}, {'question': 'When was Fox slain?', 'answers': ['One summer night in 2004,']}, {'question': 'When was her body found?', 'answers': ['June 6, 2004,', 'later that day']}, {'question': 'What was the age of Riley Fox when she died?', 'answers': ['3-year-old']}, {'question': 'What is the name of the child who was slain?', 'answers': ['Riley Fox']}, {'question': 'What was the reason the family blasts law enforcement?', 'answers': ['Her body', 'Riley', "home.

{'text': 'BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- A car bomb struck a U.S. Embassy vehicle Tuesday as it traveled along a coastal highway north of Beirut, killing at least three Lebanese civilian bystanders, according to American and Lebanese officials.\n\nLebanese soldiers and Red Cross workers stand near charred cars at the site of the explosion in Beirut.\n\nThe driver of the embassy vehicle suffered minor injuries, and the sole passenger walked away unscathed, U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said.\n\nBoth were Lebanese nationals, he said. An American citizen who happened to be in the area suffered non-life-threatening injuries, the spokesman said.\n\nLebanese internal security forces said three Lebanese civilian bystanders were killed in the explosion in Beirut\'s Dora area, contradicting earlier reports of four.\n\nTwenty-one others -- including the American bystander -- were wounded in the explosion, which was caused by a 15-kilogram (33-pound) bomb placed in a car before the explosion, the security forces said.\n\nThe United States is outraged by the terrorist attack, said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is traveling with President Bush in Saudi Arabia.\n\n"I want on behalf of our country to say to those who were wounded, and certainly to the families of those who were killed, that our condolences are with them," she added.\n\nIt was not clear whether the blast was caused by a suicide attack or by a remotely detonated car bomb.\n\nA communique issued by the U.S. Embassy in Beirut said the embassy vehicle was apparently the intended target of the attack, and identified the driver and passenger as Lebanese security personnel for the embassy.\n\nBut McCormack cautioned against jumping to any conclusions on the intended target.\n\n"We don\'t yet have a full picture of exactly what happened, who is responsible, who is exactly being targeted," he told reporters during the State Department\'s daily briefing.\n\n"We will see over the next day or two ... where the facts lead us."\n\nCiting security concerns, McCormack would also not address unconfirmed reports that the vehicle was part of a convoy for departing U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Jeffrey Feltman.\n\nA U.S. Embassy statement said Feltman canceled a farewell ceremony that he was to host Tuesday night "out of respect to the victims of today\'s terrorist explosion."\n\nIn addition to the American, an Iraqi and at least three Lebanese were among those wounded in the blast, according to a Western diplomatic source.\n\nVideo of the scene showed several damaged cars, including at least one that was left a pile of twisted metal. A nearby high-rise building also sustained damage.\n\nMohammed Chatah, senior adviser to Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, pointed out that the attack happened during "a major political crisis" in Lebanon, which has been without a president for nearly eight weeks amid a bitter political feud.\n\n"This explosion just exacerbates a difficult situation," Chatah told CNN.\n\nTuesday\'s blast appears to be the latest in a series of attacks against pro-Western, anti-Syrian targets in the Lebanese capital.\n\nMost recently, an explosion in Beirut\'s Christian suburb of Baabda killed Brig. Gen. Francois Al-Hajj, the head of operations for the Lebanese army, and his bodyguard on December 12.\n\nAl-Hajj was believed to be a top candidate to take over as army commander in the event current commander Gen. Michel Suleiman was elected to replace Emile Lahoud as president.\n\nLebanon has been in the midst of a political crisis as pro- and anti-Syrian lawmakers in parliament are locked in a battle to elect a new president.\n\nThe nation has been without a president since November 23, when the pro-Syrian Lahoud stepped down at the end of his term.\n\nIn February 2005, the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut sparked widespread protests that led to the ouster of Syrian forces from Lebanon.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Chris Helmbrecht is a 37-year-old German who lived in New York and Spain before moving to Moscow nearly six years ago. He runs an advertising agency and also writes Moscow Blog, a lifestyle blog about the city.\n\n\n\nChris Helmbrecht: "Not many places have as much energy as Moscow."\n\n\n\nCNN: You\'ve traveled around a lot -- what makes Moscow unique?\n\n\n\nChris Helmbrecht: Not many places have so much energy and so many things going on. It can be very nerve wracking and exhausting, but on the other hand it\'s very exciting. New York is one of those places, Tokyo too, but there are only a handful of cities in the world that have that kind of energy.\n\n\n\nCNN: You used to be a DJ -- what\'s your opinion of Moscow\'s nightlife?\n\n\n\nCH: For some people the nightlife is the best in the world, but for me it\'s very commercial and posh. You can sum it up in one sentence, which is a general thing about Moscow: people here live "Sex and the City." They just want to go out and spend money and pretend they\'re rich and successful and live this dream.\n\n\n\nI recently had a conversation with the club editor of Timeout Moscow and I asked her if she thought the clubs were suffering right now with the economy. She said that in the modern "New Russian" culture people would rather sell their Mercedes than not go out and spend anywhere between $4,000 and $6,000 on a table in a club and admit that they\'re not rich anymore.\n\n\n\nMoscow is dominated by posh parties, but it\'s no different at a subculture place like a techno club -- you\'re always judged by the labels you wear, the car you drive and the music you identify yourself with.\n\n\n\nCNN: Where do you like to go in the city?\n\n\n\nCH: Novodevichy Monastery is a really beautiful old monastery. Stalin demolished a lot of churches and monasteries but this one was spared. There\'s a pond below it that you can walk around, and all the Russian Orthodox popes are buried in he cemetery. It\'s a very nice place.\n\n\n\nAnother place is would be Vorobyovy Gory (Sparrow Hills), where you can look out over Moscow. It\'s pretty industrial looking but it has good views. I also enjoy the center of Moscow. I like hanging out on the roof bar of a hotel, having a drink, looking out over Red Square. It makes you feel like you\'re away from the noise of the city.\n\n\n\nWhat makes Moscow special to you? Let us know.\n\n\n\nCNN: What do Muscovites do at the weekend?\n\n\n\nCH: It depends on the time of year, but in the summer they take every opportunity to get out of the city. Everyone has a little weekend house called a "dacha" and every Friday night after work people leave the city.\n\n\n\nFrom 4pm in the afternoon to 10pm at night you have long traffic jams on all the roads out of the city. People will spend three or four hours in traffic jams just to travel 60km -- and on the way back on Sunday and Monday mornings it\'s the same.\n\n\n\nSome "dachas" are really basic wooden houses and some are palaces but every family has one, or even two or three. People go out to the woods or lakes and they have barbeques, they drink and they do some gardening. They value this "dacha" life so much that they\'re willing to spend 6 hours in traffic to spend 1 ½ days in the woods.\n\n\n\nCNN: So is Moscow is deserted in the summertime?\n\n\n\nCH: Moscow is very quiet in the summertime -- it\'s my favorite time. You can already notice that there are less people in the clubs and less people in the streets at the weekend.\n\n\n\nTowards the end of June, Moscow is really empty. You really notice it from the middle of July until September, when it\'s school vacations.\n\n\n\nCNN: Has Moscow change a lot since you moved there?\n\n\n\nCH: Yes -- you can see it renewing itself. I know how it went with Berlin -- in 10 years you won\'t recognize Moscow anymore.\n\n\n\nStreets have changed so much in the last five years, in a good way and a bad way. A lot of cool-looking brick buildings were torn down to create business centers, but on the other hand you have great new modern buildings and hotels -- the Ritz Carlton for example. There are lots of new museums popping up, art centers, alternative art, new shops and cafes.\n\n\n\nIt\'s so different to when I came here five years ago and to be honest, I never would have expected it.\n\n\n\nCNN: What do you miss about Moscow when you\'re away?\n\n\n\nCH: I miss the excitement. There\'s something going on all the time. There\'s so much choice in terms of theater, classical ballet, the nightlife, the galleries.\n\n\n\nYou have that in Berlin but it\'s harder to find and not as exciting, and New York has lost a lot of its flavor, glamour and energy at the moment.\n\n\n\nCNN: If Moscow were a person, what would he or she be like?\n\n\n\nCH: An ugly princess who wears a lot of makeup and tries to be pretty!

{'text': '(EW.com) -- Enough with the chains and whips already. Ever since 2009\'s "Rated R," the relentlessly dark, blood-on-your-hands record she released after being assaulted by her then boyfriend Chris Brown, Rihanna, 23, has equated falling for someone with feeling tortured.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn last year\'s "LOUD," she even tried to make pain seem empowering with the hard-pounding single \'\'S&M.\'\' But between \'\'Love the Way You Lie,\'\' a domestic-violence saga played out with Eminem, and \'\'Man Down,\'\' a ragga-tinged murder ballad, she just sounded like she needed a hug.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it\'s a relief to find that on her blissed-out sixth album, "Talk That Talk," she\'s stopped trying to play it so tough. \'\'I\'ll let you in on a dirty secret,\'\' she purrs on \'\'Roc Me Out,\'\' \'\'I just want to be loved.\'\' And apparently, love\'s never come so easily to RiRi, whose new song titles include \'\'We Found Love,\'\' \'\'We All Want Love,\'\' and (yes) \'\'Drunk on Love.\'\' Is she finally admitting that being young and crushed-out on someone might feel, y\'know, kind of fun?\n\n\n\n\n\nAMA adult rating flat, but a hit with teens\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue, she\'s still got two token I-like-it-rough tracks -- \'\'Birthday Cake\'\' and \'\'Cockiness (Love It)\'\' -- but they\'re just filler on an album that\'s all about dragging you out of the bedroom and onto the dance floor. U.K. club king Calvin Harris trades Rihanna\'s usual somber synths for disco ecstasy on \'\'We Found Love,\'\' a song that builds and builds to a climax that\'s so arena-ready it practically begs for someone to blow a vuvuzela.\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaming with pop vet Dr. Luke, Harris offers up more house-DJ bait with \'\'Where Have You Been,\'\' which begins with a cold-pulsing 4/4 beat before falling into a rapturous Daft Punk-style breakdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly Clarkson, Bruno Mars on \'X Factor\'\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\'s an international appeal to these songs, which were recorded in luxury suites across France, Germany, and Sweden. (For the aspirational traveler, room numbers are cited in the credits.) When Rihanna\'s not singing over Euro-friendly thumps, she\'s bouncing to a Caribbean melody, or dipping into dubstep; \'\'Watch n\' Learn\'\' begins with a reggae drum fill straight out of Bob Marley\'s \'\'Buffalo Soldier.\'\'\n\n\n\n\n\nJay-Z even touts their jet-set lifestyle on the title track, bragging that he can \'\'fly out to Ibiza/Just to get some pizza.\'\' Even with all those options, RiRi\'s ready to settle down on album highlight \'\'We All Want Love,\'\' which begins with a Red Hot Chili Peppers-echoing guitar riff and expands into a soaring sing-along.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the heartfelt power ballad \'\'Farewell\'\' finds her pledging loyalty to a guy who takes almost as many business trips as she does: \'\'Even though it kills me that you have to go/I know I\'d be sadder if you didn\'t hit the road,\'\' she wails, with just enough of a wink to make him wonder what she\'ll do while he\'s gone.

{'text': 'KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A Marine was killed in action and several others wounded Thursday in a major U.S.-led offensive in southern Afghanistan, the Marines said.\n\n\n\nU.S. Marines prepare for Operation Khanjar at Forward Operating Base Dwyer, Afghanistan, on Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe push, called Operation Khanjar, is targeting militants in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold and poppy-growing region. The forces are attempting to gain and hold ground in the perilous region ahead of national elections in August.\n\n\n\nAlmost 4,000 Marines and sailors, along with several hundred Afghan security forces and British troops, worked to clear Taliban militants from population centers in the Helmand River valley.\n\n\n\nThey have been operating in the districts of Nawa and Garmsir in central Helmand province and "as far south as the vicinity of Khan Neshin, the capital of Rig district in the region of the Helmand River valley known as \'The Fishhook.\' "\n\n\n\nThe Marines stressed the mission "is to provide security for population centers" and "connect local citizens with their legitimate government while establishing stable and secure conditions for national elections."\n\n\n\nHelmand\'s governor, Gulab Mangal, said he believes the operation will work and has assured the populace that it will provide security for them. His spokesman also confirmed that resistance had been minimal.\n\n\n\nThe Marines said about 80 percent of the American troops are in direct combat, with the rest working in support.\n\n\n\nTaliban resistance has been light and sporadic, consisting of intermittent small arms fire, the Marines said on Thursday. The troops have encountered only relatively small groups of militants.\n\n\n\n"Indications are the militants break away shortly after they make contact," Marine spokesman 1st Lt. Abe Sipe said, referring to what is regarded as the Taliban\'s habit of running and hiding after troops confront them.\n\n\n\nA Taliban spokesman said the group\'s fighters had killed 33 soldiers and destroyed several vehicles. CNN could not independently verify the Taliban claims because of safety and access issues.\n\n\n\nThere has been an outcry in Afghanistan over civilian deaths in the Afghan war\'s crossfire, with much ire directed toward coalition air operations.\n\n\n\nBut the Marine Expeditionary Brigade-Afghanistan emphasized in a news release that the Marines have not "received any confirmed reports of civilian casualties or damage to property." They said they have not utilized "artillery or other indirect fire weapons, and no bombs have been dropped from aircraft."\n\n\n\nThe brigade operates under NATO\'s International Security Assistance Force.\n\n\n\nThe assault has prompted Pakistani authorities to redeploy troops along the Afghan border to stop Taliban from escaping the push in Helmand. More than 30 U.S., British and Danish troops have been killed there since January, with the latest being the Marine on Thursday and a pair of British soldiers slain in Helmand on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe push is the largest since the Pentagon began moving additional troops into the conflict this year, and it comes after a British-led operation launched last week in the same region, the Marines said.\n\n\n\nWhen President Obama announced his strategy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan, he said American soldiers and Marines "will take the fight to the Taliban in the south and the east, and give us a greater capacity to partner with Afghan security forces and to go after insurgents along the border."\n\n\n\nHe also said the bolstered deployment "will also help provide security" ahead of August presidential elections in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration has moved about 21,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan, the original front in the war launched after the September 11 attacks.\n\n\n\nIt is also the first big move since U.S. Gen. Stanley McChrystal took over as the allied commander in Afghanistan in mid-June. In Washington, a senior defense official said the size and scope of the new operation are "very significant."\n\n\n\n"It\'s not common for forces to operate at the brigade level," the official said. "In fact, they often only conduct missions at the platoon level. And they\'re going into the most troubled area of Afghanistan."\n\n\n\nThe defense official said the operation is a "tangible indication" of the new approach that McChrystal -- a former chief of the Pentagon\'s special operations command -- is bringing to the nearly eight-year war.\n\n\n\n"They\'re not just doing an offensive push to get bad guys; they\'re going in to hold the area and stay there," the official said. "This approach is indicative of McChrystal\'s philosophy: measuring success by the number of Afghans protected, not bad guys killed."\n\n\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing in June, McChrystal told senators that the conflict requires a new focus on counterinsurgency to reduce violence and build support for the U.S.-led NATO alliance among Afghans.\n\n\n\n"Although I expect stiff fighting ahead, the measure of success will not be enemy killed. It will be shielding the Afghan population from violence," he said.\n\n\n\nThe Islamic fundamentalist Taliban ruled most of Afghanistan before its allies in al Qaeda attacked New York and Washington on September 11, 2001. Though quickly toppled after the attacks, its leaders escaped, and the movement regrouped in the Afghan countryside and across the border in Pakistan.\n\n\n\nHelmand was once known as the breadbasket of Afghanistan, but the fertile land is now used for growing poppies. Afghanistan produces more than 90 percent of the world\'s opium, with most of that coming from the poppies in Helmand.\n\n\n\nThe drug trade is an import source of income for the Taliban and major supply routes run through the province.\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Atia Abawi in Afghanistan, Nic Robertson in Pakistan and Chris Lawrence and Barbara Starr at the Pentagon contributed to this report.', 'qa': [{'question': 'how many talibam died', 'answers': ['33 soldiers']}, {'question': 'According to the Taliban, how many soldiers where killed?', 'answers': ['4,000 Marines and sailors,', '33', 'A Marine']}, {'question': 'where is the operation focused', 'answers': ['Helmand province,']}, {'question': 'Where did Operation Khanjar take place?', 'answers': ['Forward Operating Base Dwyer, Afghanistan,', 'Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold and poppy-growing region.', 'targeting militants in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold and poppy-growing region.']}, {'question': 'how many troops were involved', 'answers': ['along with several hundred', 'Almost 4,000', 'several hundred', 'Almost 4,000 Marines and sailors, along with several hundred Afghan security forces and British']}, {'question': 'How many soldiers took part in the Operation Khanjar?', 'answers': ['4,000 Marines and sailors,', '4,000', '4,000 Marines and sailors, along with several hundred Afghan security forces and British troops,']}]}
{'text': 'WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Ready for your Super Bowl party? Sure, you have drinks, hot wings, maybe even a favorite jersey. But do you have an M-16, a Kevlar helmet and body armor?\n\n\n\nPittsburgh Steelers fan Sheresa Coleman will watch the Super Bowl from the USS Mahan in the Gulf of Aden.\n\n\n\nNot everybody is watching the game from the comfort of the family den.\n\n\n\nHundreds of thousands of U.S. troops will be deployed in remote war zones, on lonely oceans and at overseas bases -- all far away from an NBC affiliate. So the military is going out of its way to make sure that many soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors can watch Super Bowl XLIII live.\n\n\n\n"Super Bowl day has really become a holiday, military-wise, over the last couple years," said Petty Officer 1st Class Grant Shannon.\n\n\n\nShannon is from a town about an hour north of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but is on board the USS Mahan, a destroyer deployed to stop pirates working off the coast of Somalia.\n\n\n\nWhen they finish their duties, sailors like Shannon can head to the ship\'s mess to watch the Pittsburgh Steelers take on the Arizona Cardinals. The same is true for soldiers, Marines and airmen in combat zones.\n\n\n\n"We can broadcast to every forward operating base in Iraq and Afghanistan," said Andreas Friedrich, the deputy director of Armed Forces Radio and Television Services, which has been sending the Super Bowl to troops overseas since the first Super Bowl, broadcasting it live since 1981.  Watch how troops will be able to watch big game »\n\n\n\nAll told, about 1 million American military personnel and civilians overseas will be able to watch the big game.\n\n\n\nSome of those watching will be benefiting from the same technology that makes Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle missions possible.\n\n\n\nA global broadcast system will beam the game to ships and submarines far out in the Pacific Ocean. GBS is how pilots in the United States can watch and fly an unmanned vehicle over a battlefield halfway around the world, and then feed what they see to the battlefield commanders on the ground below.\n\n\n\nRaytheon, the company that runs the system, will use one of its video channels to feed the game to several U.S. Navy submarines and ships in the Pacific. Tens of thousands of sailors will be able to see the game via GBS, which first broadcast a Super Bowl in 2003, according to Guy DuBois of Raytheon.\n\n\n\n"It\'s a pretty amazing feeling, when you get to do that, to watch it on the ship and knowing that everybody else is back home having a good time, just like we will be," said Petty Officer 3rd Class Ryan Wright, a Cardinals fan from Arizona. Wright is on board the USS San Antonio, an amphibious transport dock that is part of the anti-piracy task force.\n\n\n\nA Steelers fan on board the USS Mahan agrees.\n\n\n\n"It would be nice to be home and watch the game in my hometown," said Seaman Sheresa Coleman of Pittsburgh. "But it\'s a great honor to support and defend the Constitution of the United States."\n\n\n\nOne thing Wright and the other overseas Super Bowl viewers will miss is the legendary Super Bowl commercials. Friedrich said the Armed Forces Radio and Television Services would have had to pay high fees for the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl commercials to an international audience.\n\n\n\nInstead, the multimillion-dollar ads that some people consider the best part of the game will be pre-empted in favor of Department of Defense-produced ads and public service messages.\n\n\n\nStill, even without seeing football-playing Clydesdales or movie-shilling monsters, those in uniform appreciate being part of America\'s unofficial midwinter holiday.\n\n\n\n"We have lots of sailors and Marines on board who have followed the season," said Cmdr. Eric Cash, the commander of the USS San Antonio. "Any time we can enjoy some traditional American sports like the Super Bowl, it\'s always a great time for us, a good mental break and also a good time for people to get together and socialize."\n\n\n\nJust like home.

Traveling to Tennessee to shoot the movie, Cyrus said, helped keep her grounded.\n\n"It actually gave me time to relax, and it was when my career was just starting to take off ... when I was just starting to travel," Cyrus said. "It was at a time when I needed to go back home and it couldn\'t have been more of a perfect time."\n\nIn the film, opening in theaters Friday, Cyrus plays Miley Stewart, a typical teenage girl who lives a double life as a famous pop star named Hannah Montana. Eventually, Hannah begins taking over Miley\'s life, leading Miley to take a soul-searching journey back home to decide what she really wants: notoriety or normality.\n\nMiley shares the screen with her father, country musician Billy Ray Cyrus, who felt that a trip home would be beneficial to his daughter.  Watch Miley and Billy Ray discuss the film »\n\n"This is definitely an example of art imitating life imitating art. ...

That was her home."\n\nBoth on-screen and off, Miley said, she and her father share a close friendship, calling herself a "daddy\'s girl 100 percent."\n\nBetween the endless tabloid headlines and the paparazzi\'s persistence, keeping friends and family near at hand, Miley said, helps remind her of who she really is: "I think just have good friends, good family and a good team. That\'s what people miss the most, just having a good team."\n\nCo-star Lucas Till, who plays Miley\'s love interest in the film, remarked on Miley\'s down-to-earth personality.\n\n"She\'s really nice and really [endearing], and she really cares about people," he said.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Farrah Fawcett, whose public battle with anal cancer has brought new attention to a rarely discussed disease, has not been given a timetable from her doctor about how much time she has left, according to her friend Alana Stewart.\n\n\n\nFarrah Fawcett, seen here in 2006, has waged a very public battle with anal cancer.\n\n\n\n"No one has said to her you have two months to live," Stewart said Monday. "So I\'m looking at that as a really good sign."\n\n\n\nStewart talked with Lara Spencer, host of "The Insider," who discussed her interview with Fawcett\'s close friend on CNN\'s "Larry King Live" Monday night.\n\n\n\nSpencer said Fawcett, her family and friends are clinging to hope for a recovery.\n\n\n\n"She [Alana Stewart] doesn\'t want to throw out a number. And neither does Farrah. ... They\'re still hoping for that miracle," Spencer said.\n\n\n\n"Farrah\'s Story," a documentary-style program that has followed the course of her illness and showed her grueling treatment in graphic detail, aired on NBC Friday and was viewed by almost 9 million people.\n\n\n\nFawcett and partner Ryan O\'Neal watched the show together, Spencer confirmed.\n\n\n\n"Alana said it was the ultimate in bittersweet," Spencer said. "You know, they\'re reliving two years of hell that they\'ve endured together."\n\n\n\nKing asked Spencer whether Fawcett, who made her name a household word on the hit \'70s TV series "Charlie\'s Angels," and O\'Neal might marry.\n\n\n\n"He said you never know. He was cagey about it," Spencer said. "And, you know, I think he would in a second. He\'s so madly in love with her."\n\n\n\nKing also had a panel of medical experts on his show to discuss Fawcett\'s cancer.\n\n\n\nDr. Thomas Vogl, who at one time treated the actress in Germany, called her medical condition "very, very serious."\n\n\n\nDr. Allyson Ocean, a medical oncologist in New York, said only about 5,000 cases of anal cancer are diagnosed in the United States yearly. Unlike Fawcett\'s case, it usually doesn\'t spread, and only about 10 to 15 percent of cases are advanced, Ocean said. Fawcett\'s cancer, however, is in Stage 4 and has spread to her liver.\n\n\n\nOcean said there are various causes of anal cancer.\n\n\n\n"One of the causes is a virus called the human papilloma virus, which is a sexually transmitted virus. It seems to be more common in women, in general, outside of any viral infections. Smoking is actually a risk factor," she said.\n\n\n\nKing asked Dr. Paul Song, a radiation oncologist, if he had seen Stage 4 cancer cured.\n\n\n\n"Not with anal cancer. I have seen it with other GI malignancies such as rectal cancer," Song said. "But anal cancer is a little bit more difficult to treat."\n\n\n\nDespite the bleak outlook, Song had praise for Fawcett and her documentary.\n\n\n\n"I think one of the most powerful things that Miss Fawcett did in this documentary was give patients a sense of hope and to just show how she\'s handled this with such courage and dignity," Song said.\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Dr. Sanjay Gupta told King that doctors have to strike a delicate balance when they are caring for patients such as Fawcett.\n\n\n\n"You have to be absolutely honest with patients, but, you know, you don\'t want to strip away their hope and optimism, either. There are people, Larry, as you know, who beat the odds," Gupta said.\n\n\n\nVogl told King he developed a close relationship with Fawcett during the time he treated her in Germany and expressed admiration for his one-time patient.\n\n\n\n"From a lot of treatments and contact and communication, I think she is extremely special, an extremely brave person," he said.', 'qa': [{'question': 'In what way did she handle it?', 'answers': ['with such courage and dignity,"', 'clinging to hope', 'such courage and dignity,"']}, {'question': "Where are her doctor's offices located at?", 'answers': ['New York,']}, {'question': "What stage is Fawcett's cancer?", 'answers': ['is in', '4']}, {'question': 'What kind of treatment is she undergoing?', 'answers': ['"One of', 'grueling', 'and contact and communication,', 'lot of', 'a risk factor,"', 'anal cancer', 'anal cancer.', 'viral infections.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A former "Manson family" member who stabbed actress Sharon Tate to death more than 40 years ago and is now terminally ill faces her 13th parole hearing on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nSusan Atkins, shown here after her indictment in the Manson murders, has a parole hearing Wednesday.\n\n\n\nSusan Atkins, 61, has terminal brain cancer. As of earlier this year, she was paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and could not sit up in bed or be moved into a wheelchair, according to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse.\n\n\n\nHowever, despite her declining health and an impressive prison record, Whitehouse wrote, "there is still a very real chance the Parole Board will nonetheless insist her release would be a danger to society."\n\n\n\nThe hearing will be held at the Central California Women\'s Facility at Chowchilla, California, said Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Atkins was moved to the Chowchilla facility from the California Institution for Women at Frontera last year because of her illness.  Watch Linda Kasabian describe the murders »\n\n\n\n"Last we heard, she is expected to attend," Thornton said Tuesday of Atkins. The proceeding is scheduled to be held in a hearing room, but depending on Atkins\' condition, it could be held at her bedside, Thornton said. The panel is expected to render its decision following the hearing after deliberating behind closed doors, she said.\n\n\n\nAtkins -- California\'s longest-serving female inmate -- has been denied parole 12 times previously, Thornton said.\n\n\n\nShe was 21 when she and other followers of Charles Manson participated in a two-night rampage that left seven people dead and terrorized the city of Los Angeles in August 1969. She and the others -- Manson, Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles "Tex" Watson -- were initially sentenced to death in the slayings of five people, including Tate, and two additional deaths the following night.\n\n\n\nTheir sentences were automatically commuted to life in prison when the Supreme Court struck down the nation\'s death penalty laws in 1972.\n\n\n\nBy her own admission, Atkins held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy, and stabbed the actress, who was eight months pregnant, 16 times. In a 1993 parole board hearing, Atkins said Tate "asked me to let her baby live. ... I told her I didn\'t have any mercy on her."\n\n\n\nAfter killing Tate, according to historical accounts of the murders, Atkins scrawled the word "pig" in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski. Polanski was not home at the time, but three of Tate\'s houseguests were also slain by the killers, as was a teenager who was visiting the home\'s caretaker in his nearby cottage.\n\n\n\nIf the panel decides to grant Atkins parole -- called a "tentative suitability finding" -- the decision is subject to a 120-day review process by the California Board of Parole Hearings, Thornton said. If it still stands, the matter then goes to the governor\'s office. The governor\'s options include allowing the decision to stand, actively approving it, modifying it or reversing it, according to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation\'s Web site.\n\n\n\nHowever, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has previously opposed Atkins\' request for compassionate release -- a request made by terminally ill patients wishing to be released before death. The Board of Parole Hearings unanimously denied that request in July 2008. It was also opposed by Debra Tate, Sharon Tate\'s sister.\n\n\n\nIf parole is not granted, another hearing will be set in three, five, seven, 10 or 15 years, at the discretion of the panel, Thornton said.\n\n\n\nAtkins has been described as a model prisoner who has accepted responsibility for her role in the slayings and now shuns Manson.\n\n\n\nBut Debra Tate told CNN in an e-mail in March she does not believe any Manson family member convicted of murder should ever be set free, saying the slayings were "so vicious, so inhumane, so depraved, that there is no turning back."\n\n\n\n"The \'Manson Family\' murderers are sociopaths, and from that, they can never be rehabilitated," Debra Tate said. "They should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die. There will never be true justice for my sister Sharon and the other victims of the \'Manson Family.\' Keeping the murderers in prison is the least we, as a society who values justice, can do."\n\n\n\nIn a manuscript posted on her Web site, Atkins, who was known within the Manson family as Sadie Mae Glutz, wrote that "this is the past I have to live with, and I have to live with it every day."\n\n\n\n"Unlike the reader, or the people who seem to think Charles Manson was cool, I can\'t think about it for an hour or so and then go on with my life. Just like the families and friends of the victims, this is with me every day. I have to wake up every day with this and no matter what I do for the rest of my life and no matter how much I give back to the community I will never be able to replace what my crime took away. And that\'s not \'neat,\' and that\'s not \'cool.\'"\n\n\n\nAtkins\' brain cancer was diagnosed in March 2008, Whitehouse wrote on his Web site.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Doctors chose a woman who survived a shotgun wound to her face as the first recipient of a face transplant after treating her for nearly four years.\n\n\n\nThis image projects what Connie Culp, 46, may look like two years after the face transplant.\n\n\n\nConnie Culp knew of the Cleveland Clinic\'s interest in face transplants and approached the medical staff, doctors said at a news conference Tuesday.\n\n\n\nDr. Maria Siemionow, the Cleveland, Ohio, hospital\'s director of plastic surgery research and head of microsurgery training, had more than 20 years of experience in complex transplants. By 2004, Siemionow was looking for the right candidate for a face transplant who wasn\'t doing it for vanity.\n\n\n\n"They are not looking to go out on the street and be beautiful," Siemionow told CNN in a 2006 interview. "Some of these patients, when they were interviewed just said \'I want to walk on the street and just make sure I am not sticking out.\' They just want to have a normal face."\n\n\n\nThe doctors examined the patient\'s history, motivation and ability to understand the risks of the transplant. And they found Culp to be an ideal candidate.\n\n\n\nFive years after a gun blast shattered her nose, cheeks and upper lip, she had a band of scar tissue extending across her face.\n\n\n\n"The most devastating of all was the fact that society had rejected her and children were afraid of her," said Siemionow, who led the December 10 transplant operation.  See before and after photos of Culp »\n\n\n\nCulp, a mother of two and a grandmother, told her doctors she could understand that some adults would shun her.\n\n\n\n"But what really bothered her the most were children -- the children that shied away from her," said Dr. Frank Papay, the chairman of Institute of Dermatology and Plastic Surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. "That sense of innocence, and her not being able to see that innocence really, really affected her."\n\n\n\nThe shooting\n\n\n\nIn September 2004, Culp\'s estranged husband shot her in the face in an attempted murder-suicide outside a restaurant in Hopedale, Ohio, according to CNN affiliate WTOV in Steubenville, Ohio.\n\n\n\nCulp was 8 feet away from her husband, Thomas Culp, when he pulled the shotgun\'s trigger. He then turned the weapon on himself, according to local news reports. They both survived. Thomas Culp was sent to prison.\n\n\n\nDespite her wounds, she told WTOV in 2008, "I\'ll always love him. He was my first love."\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Culp said, she felt angry. "I wouldn\'t be human if I didn\'t. I forgive him, but I have to go on, you know?"\n\n\n\nAfter the shooting, Culp recuperated in a hospital and in a personal care home for two years. Culp told WTOV she had vision problems and was learning Braille.\n\n\n\nHer approach to life was to "keep motivated. Don\'t sleep your life away -- that could have happened. I could be depressed. I\'m not." As she spoke, her breaths emitted a small whistle from her tracheotomy tube, which protruded from a surgical opening in her neck.\n\n\n\n"I cannot smell. I will never be able to smell," she said in the interview.\n\n\n\nCulp was wrong.\n\n\n\nHow doctors transplanted a face\n\n\n\nThe doctors at the Cleveland Clinic analyzed Culp\'s injuries using CAT scans and developed plastic models of her skull. They practiced face transplant operation on cadavers several times.\n\n\n\nCulp met with the hospital\'s surgeons, ethical committee members and psychiatry and psychology specialists who determined that she was an ideal candidate for the surgery. Then, the wait for the right donor began in 2008.\n\n\n\n"We thought we were going to wait a long time because we had to find a Caucasian female in her mid 40s to match Connie, so we expected a year before we were able to find a donor," said Papay, who is also head of craniofacial surgery. "Well, three to four months later, I got a call at around midnight from Dr. Siemionow saying \'I think we have a donor.\'"\n\n\n\nThe family of a brain dead woman granted permission to use her face.\n\n\n\nHe likened the preparation for the December transplant to a rocket launch, saying, "Everything was prepared beforehand very, very, very carefully."\n\n\n\nSurgeons sheared out the donor\'s mid-facial area including the lower eyelids, cheekbones, the nose, some of the sinus and the whole upper jaw, with the blood vessels.  Watch CNN\'s Dr. Sanjay Gupta discuss the face transplant »\n\n\n\nWhen it came time to move the donor\'s parts to Culp, they had to see that the donor and recipient parts aligned.\n\n\n\n"One of the ways you can tell that is how your upper teeth fit to the lower teeth," Papay said. "We knew it was like a hand in a glove, exactly where we needed to be."\n\n\n\nThey secured the bones into Culp\'s face using titanium plates and screws. Then the microvascular surgeons attached the vessels. They tucked the scars around Culp\'s ears or underneath her eyelid, where they would not be visible.  How the doctors operated »\n\n\n\nDoctors added more skin than needed in case of tissue rejection. After monitoring Culp\'s progress, doctors say they will remove the excess tissue and tighten her jawline in future surgeries.\n\n\n\nContrary to science fiction and movies, the surgery did not make Culp look like the donor.\n\n\n\n"If you just took the skin and transplanted it to the other patient, the bony structure is different," Papay said. "If you took the bony structure and transplanted it on the other side, it ends up being a composite. So, it doesn\'t look like the donor. It doesn\'t look like the recipient. It ends up looking like someone new."\n\n\n\nRecovery\n\n\n\nAt this point, all the transplanted parts of Culp\'s face are functioning except for her facial nerves, which are growing about an inch a month. Doctors anticipate Culp will be able to have full facial function -- and more expression --  by this winter.\n\n\n\nIn physical therapy, she learns to train her nerves, make facial expressions, smile and purse her lips, doctors said.\n\n\n\n"If you cry or you laugh or you smile, it\'s not like you think about it. You just emotionally do it. So that\'s a wait and see for us," Papay said. "As far as the emotional one, that\'s really the key issue. A far as when she laughs, cries and grimaces and gets angry at you...what\'s her face going to look like? That\'s the exciting part about it."\n\n\n\nFive months after the first face transplant in the United States, Culp lives at home. She has checkups with the medical staff once or twice a month and will do so for the next year, her doctors said.\n\n\n\nInitially, Culp used immunosuppressants that transplanted kidney, liver or heart patients would normally take. Transplant patients must take immune-suppressing drugs throughout their lifetime to prevent tissue rejection. But she showed improvements that enabled the doctors to reduce her regimen to one medication, doctors said.\n\n\n\n"She\'s taking her medications," Siemionow said. "We know she is compliant. She cares about how she looks. She has her hair done in a new color...She is full of life. She does her push-ups. She\'s on the treadmill.

{'text': '(CNN) -- The head of JetBlue is apologizing for a "confluence of events" that left a plane filled with passengers stranded on the tarmac at Bradley International Airport near Hartford, Connecticut, over the weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief Operating Officer Rob Maruster said in a video posted on the company\'s blog and its YouTube Channel that the airline had six flights divert to Hartford during the freak weekend snowstorm "due to various runway, congestion and other operational issues at Newark and JFK Airports" and that the airline "did not deplane those aircraft in our target time allotted."\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of those flights, JetBlue 504 from Fort Lauderdale spent nearly eight hours stranded on the tarmac before passengers were allowed to deplane.\n\n\n\n\n\n"At no point in this weekend was safety ever compromised," Maruster said, stressing that safety was the airline\'s number one concern.\n\n\n\n\n\n"But let\'s face it, you count on us at JetBlue for a lot more -- and we promise a lot more -- and we know we let some of you down over the course of this weekend and for that we are truly sorry."\n\n\n\n\n\nMaruster said the airline intends to "fully participate with the Department of Transportation and cooperating with their investigation into events over the weekend, and we\'re also going to conduct an internal evaluation so that we can learn from this event because at the end of the day, you deserve better -- and we expect better from our crewmembers and our operation."\n\n\n\n\n\n"We can only earn your loyalty and trust one flight at a time and we ask you to give us a second chance."\n\n\n\n\n\nJetBlue Flight 504 departed Fort Lauderdale at 10:07 a.m. ET Saturday -- 32 minutes late.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flight made it to Newark -- just not to the runway, thanks to the weather before it was diverted to Hartford.

{'text': 'Editor\'s note: Journalist Karl Penhaul spent several weeks tracking the gangs of the Mexican underworld, the corrupt officials who support them and the cops trying to halt the violence. This is the last of three exclusive reports. The first focused on the violent rules gangs live by and the second looked at  how gangsters are honored in death.\n\nForensic investigators and federal police dig bodies out of mass graves in the desert near Juarez.\n\nJUAREZ, Mexico (CNN) -- Heat waves shimmer over the desert. A team of forensic experts clad in white overalls excavate three shallow graves.\n\nThe sand gives up nine bodies -- seven men and two women. At least one of the victims\' hands were cuffed behind their back. Others had been trussed up with duct tape.\n\nThe stale stench reveals that the corpses had been dumped there several days earlier and were decomposing fast.\n\nThat grisly find in mid-March came a week after thousands more soldiers had been deployed to Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. The arrival of the soldiers and more federal police agents had coincided with a short lull in the killings.\n\nSnapping photos of the scene from behind the police line was Lucio Soria, photographer for Juarez\'s main newspaper, El Diario de Juarez, and its sister paper, PM.\n\nPM is a perfect example of Mexico\'s so-called "red press," newspapers that specialize in covering violence. Soria seems like a perfect ambassador.\n\n"I\'ve gone for a week and a half without taking pictures of dead people. I was thinking \'Hell, what am I going to do?\' At this rate I\'ll end up taking pictures for the social pages," he said.\n\nSoria realizes snapping pictures of blood and gore may seem heartless. But he stays cheerful, cracking dark jokes with colleagues, all while listening to police communications on a radio scanner and searching for clues about where to find the next drug war victim.\n\n"It might seem ugly, but that\'s our job," Soria said.\n\nHe and fellow photographers have been busy in recent months.\n\nLast year, Juarez became the poster city for Mexico\'s narco-violence, with more than 1,600 gang killings.  Watch musicians play "narco-ballads" honoring hitmen »\n\nThis year, Mayor Jose Reyes is trying to turn a page on the killings and make Juarez a showcase for solutions.\n\nMilitary and federal police convoys patrol the streets around the clock.

Watch cops round up gang suspects »\n\nSoldiers strike a warlike pose behind heavy machine guns mounted on American-made Humvees.\n\nWhether it\'s working depends on whom you ask and how hard you read between the lines.\n\n"I think this is very effective because it closes transport routes for the movement of [cartel] personnel and weapons," said a state officer, assigned to guide us, at a federal police checkpoint.\n\nThe officer, known only by his call sign Trojan One, seemed confident.\n\nThe agent in command of the checkpoint was less convinced.\n\n"Of course organized crime is trying to avoid us. I\'m not sure what methods they use to operate. We don\'t know how they work," said the officer, identifying himself only as Aztec One.\n\nOn another day we ran into a three-truck federal police operation staking out a house in a middle-class Juarez neighborhood.  See photos of police, gang life in Mexico »\n\nThe commander said his men believed they had made what he termed a "major" cocaine bust. When I met him they had already been waiting almost 24 hours for a judge to issue a search warrant.\n\nWhen they gained access they discovered some 500 half-gram bags of cocaine. In Juarez those bags sell for around $8. Now do the math, 500 half-gram bags at possibly 60 percent purity means around 150 grams of pure cocaine -- hardly a major strike in the drug war.\n\nReyes\' solution has been to hand the military all civilian police functions, even down to traffic control. Mexico\'s military has little experience in urban warfare, little experience in policing and has been unable to shake a decades-old reputation for human rights abuses.\n\nWhen I bump into Reyes at a transfer-of-command ceremony at city hall I ask him what he\'s doing about alleged corruption and complicity among politicians and businessmen, who permit the cartels to move their shipments and help launder the proceeds.\n\n"My opinion in Juarez is that that kind of political corruption does not exist," he said adamantly.\n\nTwo weeks later, in Monterrey, I caught up with outspoken lawyer Raquenel Villanueva. She knows a thing or two about politicians colluding with Mexico\'s mafia.

{'text': 'LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Former detainees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the country during their deportation.\n\nRaymond Soeoth, pictured here with his wife, says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will.\n\nOne of the drugs in question is the potent anti-psychotic drug Haldol, which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses. Doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered.\n\nTwo immigrants, Raymond Soeoth of Indonesia and Amadou Diouf of Senegal in West Africa, told CNN they were injected with the drugs against their will.\n\nBoth are plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the government. They are seeking an end to the alleged practice and unspecified damages.  Watch why the former detainees claim abuse »\n\nDr. Paul Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry, law and ethics at Columbia University, reviewed both men\'s medical records for this report and was stunned by what he discovered.\n\n"I\'m really shocked to find out that the government has been using physicians and using potent medications in this way," said Appelbaum, who also serves as a member of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.\n\n"That is the sort of thing that would be subject to a malpractice claim in the civilian world."\n\nThe allegations of ICE forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, during the re-nomination hearing of ICE chief Julie Myers.\n\n"The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling, particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards," Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips told CNN in an e-mail.\n\n"Senator Lieberman intends to follow up with ICE to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so."\n\nACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham, who is representing Soeoth and Diouf, said, "It would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who isn\'t even mentally ill. ... But here, it\'s happening on U.S. soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport."\n\nResponding to Lieberman\'s written questions, Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had "medical escorts" for deportation since 2003.\n\nFrom October last year to the end of April this year, she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process. Of those, 33 detainees received medication "because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self," she said.\n\n"First, I am aware of, and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards," Myers said.\n\nShe added no detainee should be "involuntarily medicated without court order," except in emergency situations.\n\nBut both Soeoth and Diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior.\n\nSoeoth, a Christian minister from Indonesia, spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected. Hours before he was to be sent back home on December 7, 2004, he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days. See the document that shows Soeoth was injected\n\n"They pushed me on the bench, they opened my pants, and they just give me injection," he said through broken English.\n\nHe says he was taken to Los Angeles International Airport while in this drug-induced stupor, but two hours before takeoff, airline security refused to transport him, so ICE agents returned him to his cell at Terminal Island near Los Angeles. Terminal Island, once a federal prison, is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation.\n\nSoeoth\'s medical records indicate he was injected with Cogentin and Haldol, even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness.\n\nIn the records, the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark Soeoth denies ever making.\n\nICE said in a written statement it couldn\'t respond to specific allegations due to pending litigation.\n\n"Department of Homeland Security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees," the ICE statement said. "Only trained and qualified medical professionals, including officers of the U.S. Public Health Service, may prescribe or administer medication."\n\nBut, Diouf says, he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported. He said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his U.S. government escorts wouldn\'t let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country. See Diouf\'s stay of deportation document\n\nThat\'s when, he says, "I was wrestled to the ground and injected through my clothes."\n\nA government report says he was medicated because he did not follow orders.\n\nIn both cases, Diouf and Soeoth remain in the United States pending a decision in the case. If they lose, they may land back in the hands of ICE, once again facing deportation.\n\nSoeoth says he\'s traumatized by what happened.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Union workers armed with an estimated 1.5 million signatures converged on Washington on Wednesday, demanding that Congress pass their highest-priority legislation.\n\n\n\nUnion chief Andy Stern wants workers to have another way to organize besides relying on a secret ballot.\n\n\n\nThey are lobbying for the Employee Free Choice Act. The legislation would allow a company\'s employees to openly sign a card demanding a union and then, if a majority sign, the company involved would have 90 days to negotiate. The act would also stiffen federal laws that bar employers from intimidating or firing workers who try to bring in a union.\n\n\n\nBut while the battle is just beginning on Capitol Hill, business owners like Dave Bego have been in the center of the fight for some time.\n\n\n\nBego, of Indianapolis, Indiana, is the owner of EMS, a company that provides janitors to businesses around the country. The family-owned company has been under fire by one of the nation\'s most powerful labor organizations, the Service Employees International Union.\n\n\n\nThe 1.8 million-member SEIU argues that EMS intimidates, harasses and violates the rights of workers wanting to unionize. It has made the company a target of repeated protests for about three years. But Bego said the claims are unfounded, and it\'s the union that has harassed him.  Watch how company, union are at odds »\n\n\n\nHe said the union has sent his clients threatening letters for using his company, staged noisy protests, confronted employees, blocked building entrances and released balloons in a client\'s building to disrupt business. He said his workers don\'t want a union, because they make more in pay and benefits without having to pay SEIU\'s labor dues.\n\n\n\n"We have several hundred people working for us in Indianapolis [alone]," Bego said. "They\'ve been after us for almost three years, and they\'ve got only about 10 or 12 people interested in what they said. If our people really needed protecting, don\'t you think they\'d be out in mass droves in the street with the union protesting EMS? Do you think we\'d still be in business? I don\'t think so."\n\n\n\nBut union workers CNN talked to said EMS employees are afraid to speak publicly because they might get fired, as Shaneka Brown said she was. She said EMS fired her after she complained about what she said were unsafe conditions.\n\n\n\n"We\'re not the only ones," Brown said. "There are millions of other janitors and millions and millions of other companies that are going through same similarities or different similarities, but they\'re going through things that are not right and not safe." That\'s why she supports the Employee Free Choice Act, she said.\n\n\n\n"When polls show that 60 percent of the workers in America want to organize, yet only 7 percent belong to unions, you know something\'s broken," one of the bill\'s sponsors, Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, told Wednesday\'s union rally in Washington.\n\n\n\nThe option to vote by secret ballot would still be available. But critics say the measure -- dubbed the "card check" bill by its opponents -- would effectively eliminate union elections, removing a fundamental hard-earned right of workers and forcing some workers into unions they don\'t want to join.\n\n\n\n"Card check is real simple," Bego said. "They want to eliminate the secret ballot election. And that is kind of like saying, \'We\'re going to elect the president of our country by signing cards. We\'re going to go door to door and you\'re going to sign a card for who you want to be president.\' "\n\n\n\nBego said if his employees want a union, they should be able to secretly vote for one. He offered to hold union elections at his company, but only if they were monitored by the National Labor Relations Board and involved secret ballots.\n\n\n\nHe said the union did not respond, but continued the protests. He took out an ad in the Indianapolis Star, challenging SEIU to "fish or cut bait."\n\n\n\nAndy Stern, president of the SEIU and a major supporter of President Barack Obama, said the legislation provides employees who have been intimidated by their employers an opportunity to freely and openly support a union.\n\n\n\n"This isn\'t necessarily an election," Stern said. "This is people wanting to start an organization."\n\n\n\n"This is workers\' choice," Stern said.

{'text': 'Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Just like any other first family in the world, North Korea\'s secretive Kim dynasty is often the focus of gossip and rumors, especially in neighboring South Korea.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a lot of speculation after a recent report that Kim Jong Il\'s grandson, identified as 16-year-old Kim Han-sol, was scheduled to enter an international school in Bosnia. Less than a week after the report, YouTube screen shots and pictures -- reportedly of the grandson -- have been plastered on the news in South Korea.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korea\'s Yonhap News Agency reported that it had tracked down photos of the grandson from the Bosnian school\'s Facebook page and published the pictures. The young man appears in photos wearing a suit and black horn-rimmed glasses posing with a woman at what appears to be a party.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another photo, the young man sports a blonde hairdo and is wearing a black T-shirt on the streets. The news agency reported Kim\'s nationality on the school website was set as North Korean. The school, the United World College in Mostar, confirmed its acceptance of a 16-year-old North Korean student named Kim Han-sol through a press release but stopped short of confirming the identity of the individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The entry of a student from North Korea, furthermore from a very well-known family, has understandably generated surprise and comment, some of it critical," it said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Yonhap News Agency, Kim Han-sol is the son of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il\'s oldest son, Kim Jong-nam. Kim Jong-nam is the family\'s most outspoken member and has been seen at airports and other venues outside of North Korea. He is viewed by many as the outcast of the Kim family. It is believed the oldest Kim fell out of favor when he was stopped in Japan trying to enter on a forged passport on his way to Disneyland in 2001.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe South Korean media has also focused on YouTube postings that Yonhap News Agency says feature Kim Han-sol. Yonhap released shots in which the YouTube user claims to be a North Korean studying in Macau. The person also claims to be "related (to the Kim family)."\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN could not independently confirm the identity of the YouTube user or the person shown in the pictures in the South Korean media. There are no known public photographs of Kim Han-sol and there\'s been no comment from the Kim family.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reclusive nature of the family leaves media outlets to leap at whatever opportunity they can to gain more insight into the lives of the Kim Jong Il family. Experts have commonly used photos released by the North Korean state-run news agency to speculate on the health of Kim Jong Il, examining facial color, posture, and even the style of shoes the leader is wearing.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the lack of access to verify most of what is circulated in the news has also led to blunders in the past. A photograph once released as an exclusive shot of one of the leader\'s sons later turned out to be an average South Korean man. The incident was only corrected after the man in the photo spoke out saying he was shocked to see he had turned into a Kim dynasty member overnight.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the latest round of speculation continues, the YouTube account reportedly linked to the grandson is no longer accessible and has been closed.', 'qa': [{'question': 'who  will reportedly attend a Bosnian international school?', 'answers': ['Kim Han-sol,']}, {'question': 'when The 16-year-old Kim Han-sol will reportedly attend a Bosnian international school?', 'answers': ['Less than a week']}, {'question': 'whose  family is rarely shown in photographs?', 'answers': ['Kim Han-sol', 'dynasty', 'Kim', "North Korea's secretive Kim"]}, {'question': "who  has published alleged photos of Kim Jong Il's grandson?", 'answers': ["South Korea's Yonhap News Agency", 'YouTube']}, {'question': 'Where did the pictures come from?', 'answers': ["Bosnian school's Facebook page", 'YouTube']}]}
{'text': 'ATLANTA, Georgia -- Going back to work after my wife had our first child was an emotional roller coaster.\n\n\n\nThe author says that being "Mr. Mom" is appealing, but putting the idea into practice is harder than it looks.\n\n\n\nI forced myself out of bed, shaved my beard and got dressed on the morning of my return. I performed these work week rituals while cursing the fact that I matched only one number on my last lottery ticket, so I had to show up that day.\n\n\n\nAfter being out of the office for a little more than two weeks on paternity leave, I knew the transition back to work would be tough. I coped with this fact, like any rational new parent would, by increasing the number of lottery tickets that I purchased.\n\n\n\nSaying goodbye took a while. I made several trips up and down the stairs to get one more glimpse of my daughter before succumbing to the inevitable: my commute, fighting traffic and reintegrating to cubicle culture.\n\n\n\nI arrived at the office still thinking of my family at home without me. I found myself misty-eyed at the water cooler while I waited for Outlook to load several hundred unread e-mails. At that moment, I wanted nothing more than to be at home with my daughter.\n\n\n\nThe idea of being a stay-at-home dad, like Michael Keaton in "Mr. Mom," always appealed to me. For the uninitiated, the 1983 comedy is about an out-of-work father faced with domestic challenges while his wife gets a job.\n\n\n\nA memorable scene has the title character, Jack Butler, trying to sound like he knows what he\'s talking about to his wife\'s new boss. He tells him that he plans to wire a new wing of his house in "220, 221, whatever it takes."\n\n\n\nI identify with the latter part of his character\'s claim. It\'s not like me to pretend to know anything about home improvement, but when it comes to caring for my family while balancing my responsibilities at work, I plan on doing whatever it takes.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, 37 percent of working dads admitted that they would leave their jobs if their family could afford it, according to CareerBuilder.com. The "if" in that statistic is a big one.\n\n\n\nUnlike the characters in "Mr. Mom," my wife and I both need to work. A good sequel to this film may have explored the hijinks that ensued from an overwhelmed parent caring for a newborn while working from home.\n\n\n\nNowadays, there\'s support for all of the Jack Butlers out there. Web sites such as AtHomeDad.org and Rebeldad.com have established online communities dedicated to providing tips and resources for fatherhood.\n\n\n\nThese forums represent a growing fellowship where those with experience can help new dads. Personally, I haven\'t utilized them much yet because of that old Groucho Marx joke about not wanting to be a member of a club that would have a person like me as a member.\n\n\n\nAvailable resources and social acceptance for stay-at-home dads have come a long way since "Mr. Mom\'s" portrayal of them. In fact, Salary.com calculated that a stay-at-home dad was worth $125,340 a year for the dad portion of his work in 2006. This analysis took into account tasks that range from cooking and cleaning to teaching and serving as a child psychologist.\n\n\n\nSince I can\'t convince anyone to pay me my estimated worth as an at-home dad -- and living on one salary isn\'t an option for my family -- I\'ve considered working from home a couple of hours a week when necessary.\n\n\n\nFlexible work schedules make sense because they benefit a company by allowing employees to be more productive on their terms. Nevertheless, working from home may not be for everyone.\n\n\n\nI work for a news Web site, facilitating advertisement opportunities. A lot of my job\'s communication occurs via e-mail, which is something I can do at home.\n\n\n\nI\'d worked from home before, but not with a newborn in the house. My first test was only for a couple of hours when the baby was about 3 weeks old.\n\n\n\nMy wife had an early appointment, and I was going to watch the baby sleep, hopefully, and then go into the office after she got home. I had e-mail to check and two conference calls scheduled back-to-back during that time. I didn\'t expect this to be too difficult.\n\n\n\nI caught up on the e-mail much earlier than if I had gone into the office that morning. Unfettered from the restriction of the morning rituals, my productivity was already soaring and I was ahead of schedule.\n\n\n\nThen disaster struck.\n\n\n\nAs I called into my first meeting, the baby started to stir, squirm and make her signature sounds (a primal series of grunts, snorts and whimpers). She was telling me that her diaper needed to be changed and that she was probably hungry, too.\n\n\n\nSo I did what any multi-tasker would do: I put the phone under my ear, stuck her bottle under the tap, muted the phone, ran up the stairs with her in a tucked football position, unmuted the phone, answered a question, muted again, changed her diaper and ran down the stairs to get the bottle.\n\n\n\nMy wife called while I was juggling the baby, diaper, bottle and meeting to let me know that she was running late. I screamed to myself, "I need help NOW!"\n\n\n\nAllowing the nervous breakdown to run its course, I continued to pace across my living room floor -- regretting that I hadn\'t chosen decaf that morning.\n\n\n\nA few minutes later, I jumped out of the first meeting to call into the second. I said, "Hello, this is Josh, I\'m here on mute, OK, thanks."\n\n\n\nAs I listened in on mute, I shushed my baby to calm her -- to no avail. Her cries became increasingly louder. My boss asked, "Josh, are you there?"\n\n\n\nI unmuted my phone and right on cue, my daughter screamed at the top of her little lungs.\n\n\n\nThe conference room on the other end of the phone erupted with laughter, and I told them that I\'d have to get back to them.\n\n\n\nMy wife arrived home shortly after the conference-call debacle. I told her that I didn\'t think it would be a good idea for me to work from home anymore.\n\n\n\nI realize that the ability to work and be a nanny simultaneously is a skill requiring practice.\n\n\n\nOne trial run as a telecommuter with a newborn has caused me to question the feasibility of being able to do it on a regular basis.\n\n\n\nPerhaps it\'s time for me to forget about that old Groucho Marx joke and accept some help.

Jackson, South Carolina\n\n\n\nTranscript\n\n\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\nNATISHA LANCE, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: A member of the military is making history. We'll explain how in today's edition of CNN Student News. Hi, everyone. Carl Azuz is off this week. I'm Natisha Lance.\n\n\n\nFirst Up: Afghan Crashes\n\n\n\nLANCE: First up, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The countries share a border, and they also share a common problem: threats from militant groups and terrorists like the Taliban and al Qaeda. It's an issue facing both nations' governments, and one that the U.S. government is concerned about as well. That's why President Obama has been holding a series of meetings with some of his advisers. They're reviewing the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Samantha Hayes has the latest on those meetings and on the violence in the region.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO)\n\n\n\nSAMANTHA HAYES, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: Two helicopter crashes make it the deadliest day in four years for Americans in Afghanistan. While a NATO security force spokesman says enemy fire is not to blame, the loss of 14 Americans comes while President Barack Obama is considering a request to send thousands more troops to the region to fight al Qaeda. The president addressed service men and women in Jacksonville, Florida Monday, after a White House meeting with his national security team.\n\n\n\nU.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Fourteen Americans gave their lives, and our prayers are with these service members, their civilian colleagues and the families who loved them.\n\n\n\nHAYES: The deadliest of the two crashes happened following a raid on suspected drug traffickers, and three DEA agents were among those killed. Also among the dead, three U.S. civilians, members of the embassy community. The State Department says the efforts of civilians and other nonmilitary personnel are essential to the overall mission.\n\n\n\nJACOB LEW, DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE: Improving Afghan governance, providing security, justice, jobs and services, and giving the Afghan people a meaningful alternative, as much as possible, to the Taliban's recruiting.\n\n\n\nHAYES: Democratic Senator John Kerry, off of a recent trip to the region, addressed those efforts and the U.S. relationship with the Afghan government in a Washington speech.\n\n\n\nSEN. JOHN KERRY, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: The fact that the Afghan government has not prosecuted a single high level drug trafficker damages all of our efforts because it goes to the fundamental question of credibility.\n\n\n\nHAYES: President Obama's White House meeting was the sixth in a series of high-level discussions about what to do in Afghanistan, as the administration awaits results from that country's November 7th presidential runoff. For CNN Student News, I'm Samantha Hayes.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO)\n\n\n\nI.D. Me\n\n\n\nCNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I was born in 1939 in Searchlight, Nevada. I was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986, and I'm currently the Senate Majority Leader, which means I'm the highest ranking member of the Senate's majority party. I'm Harry Reid, a Democrat who is the senior senator from Nevada.\n\n\n\nPublic Option\n\n\n\nLANCE: And in that role as majority leader, it's Sen. Reid's job to help combine health care bills from different committees into a single bill that can be presented to the entire Senate. Yesterday, Sen. Reid announced that the combined bill will include a government-run health care program; what's been called the public option. During his announcement, Reid also said that the bill will let individual states choose not to take part in the public option. They would have until the year 2014 to make that decision.\n\n\n\nThis has been one of the most controversial issues in the debate over health care reform. Critics argue that if companies use the public option, then some people might lose the health care coverage that they currently have and are happy with. But Sen. Reid believes it's an important part of the reform.\n\n\n\nSEN. HARRY REID, (D-NV) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I believe that the public option can achieve a goal of bringing meaningful reform to our broken system. It will protect consumers, keep insurers honest, ensure competition, and that's why we intend to include it in the bill that we submitted, that will be submitted to the Senate.\n\n\n\nTea Party Protests\n\n\n\nLANCE: Meanwhile, the Tea Party Express is back on the road, protesting issues like government involvement in health care. The Express, which is named for both the organization and its bus, launched a new tour Sunday in California with rallies in San Diego and Los Angeles, where some people actually showed up to protest the Tea Party protesters. The Express plans to hold demonstrations in dozens of cities over the next several weeks. One of the group's main goals is the push for less government involvement, and these rallies also aim to give people who feel that way an opportunity to express their views.\n\n\n\nCHRIS KEAYS, TEA PARTY PROTESTER: We need to get back to the days when we were responsible and we assumed the responsibility of ourselves and our families, and the government is not a part of my daily life. I really resent the government taking up so much of my time that I'm down here having to protest right now.\n\n\n\nNew Jobs Outlook\n\n\n\nLANCE: And some potentially good news for the U.S. economy: A new survey indicates that companies are planning to hire more employees in the very near future. The report from the National Association of Business Economics says for the first time since the recession started nearly two years ago, the number of employers planning to hire workers over the next six months is higher than the number of jobs that are expected to be cut during that same time. The country's current unemployment rate is 9.8 percent. That's the highest the statistic has been in more than a quarter century.\n\n\n\nShoutout\n\n\n\nTOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What base is home to the U.S. Army's Drill Sergeant School? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Fort Bragg, B) Fort Hood, C) Fort Jackson or D) Fort Knox? You've got three seconds -- GO! You'll find the Army's Drill Sergeant School at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout!\n\n\n\nTop Drill Sergeant\n\n\n\nLANCE: Drill sergeants are responsible for training tens of thousands of soldiers every year. And the head of the Drill Sergeant School, its commandant, is responsible for training them. The current commandant broke new ground when she took over the position last month because she's the first she to head up the school. Jason Carroll introduces us to this trailblazing soldier.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO)\n\n\n\nJASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Historically, this is the image of the military drill sergeant: a tough guy. That was then; this is now. At 48, Command Sergeant Major Teresa King is the first woman to lead the Army's Drill Sergeant Training School.\n\n\n\nWhat are you looking for? I mean, because it all pretty much looks like everybody's exercising to me.\n\n\n\nCMD. SGT. MAJOR TERESA KING: I'm looking for attention to detail, conformance.\n\n\n\nCARROLL: Before sunrise at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina, King readies her drill instructor candidates for a rigorous run.\n\n\n\nWhat's wrong with that?\n\n\n\nKING: That's too big, Top. You need to break it up.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fall out!\n\n\n\nCARROLL: She leads by example. King runs the five-mile course from the front of the pack, outperforming men half her age.\n\n\n\nSTAFF SGT. LERON DELANEY, U.S. ARMY: She's older than me, so if I fall out and she's still running, I feel bad.\n\n\n\nCARROLL: Extinguishing those who think a woman can't be commandant.\n\n\n\nSGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL CHILDS, U.S. ARMY: We've got to stay on top of our game even more than we used to with her, because she's that sharp.\n\n\n\nCARROLL: King says she wakes up some mornings still shocked she is commandant.\n\n\n\nKING: I had never considered it, although I've been in training for about seven years. But I never considered it, the Drill Sergeant School.\n\n\n\nCARROLL: King's first Army job some 30 years ago was postal clerk, but her hero, General George Patton, inspired her.\n\n\n\nKING: I saw that he had the respect of his men. And I saw he was resolute.\n\n\n\nCARROLL: King eventually rose through the ranks, excelling at training infantry men and paratroopers alike.\n\n\n\nKING: I'm doing what I've always done. It's just now, people are paying attention to it.\n\n\n\nCARROLL: And to her opinions. The military prohibits women from serving in front line combat roles. King trains men for combat and thinks it's time to train qualified women.\n\n\n\nKING: I think if they can do it, they should be allowed to do it.\n\n\n\nCARROLL: The reality: Women make up 14 percent of active soldiers in the Army. Some women question how many others will follow in King's footsteps.\n\n\n\nOPERATIONS SGT. ANGELA ANDREWS, U.S. ARMY: I wouldn't say it opens the door, but it may crack it somewhat.\n\n\n\nCARROLL: King says she will continue to lead by example.\n\n\n\nKING: I have vision. And I believe I can cause people to do some things that they thought they never could do.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO)\n\n\n\nBefore We Go\n\n\n\nAZUZ: Before we go, some science projects can balloon out of control. Which was the whole point of this experiment in Indiana. College students filled this high altitude balloon with helium and then let it fly away. The thing actually climbed 90,000 feet before... awww. Looks like their bubble burst. Actually, they knew it would. The cameras and sensors inside the balloon gently parachuted back to the ground. So in the end, the experiment was a total success.\n\n\n\nGoodbye\n\n\n\nAZUZ: Just don't tell that to the students. We wouldn't want them to get an inflated ego. That's all the time we have for today.

{'text': 'LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson\'s memorial service will take place Tuesday morning in the Staples Center, the 20,000-seat coliseum in downtown Los Angeles where Jackson rehearsed his show the night before he died, according to a person who has been briefed by a representative of the family.\n\n\n\nMichael Jackson was rehearsing at Los Angeles\' Staples Center. His memorial will now be there.\n\n\n\nNo other details about the service, set to begin at 10 a.m. Tuesday, have been revealed.\n\n\n\nThursday, CNN learned the family trust created by Jackson to receive all of his assets includes his mother, his children and a list of charities, according to a person with direct knowledge to the contents of the trust.\n\n\n\nKatherine Jackson\'s 40 percent share would go to Michael Jackson\'s three children after her death, the source said.\n\n\n\nThe children -- ages 7, 11 and 12 -- will also share 40 percent of the estate\'s assets and the remaining 20 percent will benefits charities designated by the executors of the will, the source said.\n\n\n\nJackson\'s will did not specify where he wished to be buried.\n\n\n\nMany of his fans had hoped they\'d get a chance to pay last respects at Neverland Ranch, which Jackson purchased in 1987, filled with animals and amusement rides, and named after the fictional world in J.M. Barrie\'s "Peter Pan."\n\n\n\nPlanning had been under way for a motorcade to carry Jackson\'s body from Los Angeles to the ranch in Santa Barbara County, California, which state and local officials suggested would be difficult and costly.\n\n\n\nA public viewing at the ranch on Friday also had been under consideration, law enforcement sources said.\n\n\n\nGregory Son, a 31-year-old musician, was among many fans who had planned to ride to the ranch to say goodbye to Jackson.\n\n\n\n"I think he was a modern-day prophet," Son said outside Grauman\'s Chinese Theater in Hollywood. "We kind of lost our father."\n\n\n\nDEA joins investigation\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday night, a federal law enforcement official said Wednesday night that the Drug Enforcement Administration had joined Jackson\'s death investigation, once again fanning speculation that drugs may have been involved in the pop icon\'s passing.\n\n\n\nTwo law enforcement officials separately confirmed the DEA probe, saying agents would look at various doctors involved with Jackson, their practices and their possible sources of medicine supply.\n\n\n\nNeither official wanted to be identified because they could not comment publicly on the matter.\n\n\n\nOfficially, a DEA spokeswoman referred questions to the Los Angeles, California, police department -- which would not confirm the involvement.\n\n\n\n"We routinely offer assistance to any agency regarding the Federal Controlled Substance Act," said Sarah Pullen of the DEA. "However, at this time, we have nothing further to comment about the death of Michael Jackson."\n\n\n\nSpeculation about the role of drugs has been swirling since Jackson died on June 25 at his rented estate in Holmby Hills. The cause of his death, at age 50, was pending toxicology results.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, police released a car belonging to Jackson\'s cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray. They had impounded the vehicle Friday, saying it might contain evidence -- possibly prescription medications.\n\n\n\nPolice did not say whether they found anything.\n\n\n\nMurray\'s lawyers issued a statement, asking the public to reserve judgment about the cause of death until the coroner\'s tests are complete.\n\n\n\n"Based on our agreement with Los Angeles investigators, we are waiting on real information to come from viable sources like the Los Angeles medical examiner\'s office about the death of Michael Jackson," the statement said. "We will not be responding to rumors and innuendo."\n\n\n\nThe comments were in reaction to a claim by a nutritionist who said Jackson suffered from severe bouts of insomnia and pleaded for the powerful sedative, Propofol, despite knowing its harmful effects.\n\n\n\n"I told him this medication is not safe," said Cherilyn Lee, a registered nurse. "He said, \'I just want to get some sleep. You don\'t understand.

Rowe has not publicly indicated whether she will challenge the Jacksons for custody.\n\n\n\nThe two men whom the will named as executors immediately filed a request to take control of the estate.\n\n\n\nOne is John Branca, who represented Jackson from 1980 until 2006 and was hired again before the singer\'s death.

{'text': 'QUANTICO, Virginia (CNN) -- Motorcycle accidents have killed more Marines in the past 12 months than enemy fire in Iraq, a rate that\'s so alarming, it has prompted top brass to call a meeting to address the issue, officials say.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite crashes, Gunnery Sgt. Art Tucker rides a sport motorcycle. "I enjoy it. ... It relaxes me," he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwenty-five Marines have died in motorcycle crashes since November -- all but one of them involving sport bikes that can reach speeds of well over 100 mph, according to Marine officials. In that same period, 20 Marines have been killed in action in Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 25 deaths are the highest motorcycle death toll ever for the Marine Corps.\n\n\n\n\n\nGen. James Amos, the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, told CNN that commanders are trying to drill down on what "we need to do to help our Marines survive on these sport bikes."\n\n\n\n\n\n"The Marines are very serious about it," he said.  Watch these aren\'t your father\'s Harleys »\n\n\n\n\n\nMarine Gunnery Sgt. Art Tucker knows all too well about the dangers of sport bikes. An owner of a Kawasaki Ninja, Tucker has had two crashes, and the second one nearly killed him.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I sustained a broken collar bone; I tore the shoulder out of the socket; I tore three ligaments in the shoulder, the rotator cuff; I broke three vertebrae," said Tucker, a drill instructor for new officers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The worst was a head injury I received: a bruised brain. And it caused hemorrhaging, and from that I had partial paralysis of the left leg, full paralysis of the left foot and toes, and that was for approximately six months."\n\n\n\n\n\nAmos said he and other top Marine officials will spend half the day Monday "focusing on nothing but motorcycle issues." The commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James Conway, and other senior leadership will attend the meeting at the Quantico, Virginia, Marine base, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 18,000 of the nearly 200,000 Marines are believed to own motorcycles, Amos said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Marines have taken some measures. The Marine Corps has had a long-standing policy for all Marines who ride motorcycles to take a mandatory basic riding course. More recently, it added a second training course specifically designed to train Marines who ride sport bikes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny Marine caught riding, even on leave, without going through the training courses faces Marine Corps punishment, officials say.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a recent day at the Quantico training track, Marines whizzed by on their bikes.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I think the basic rider course has been great," said Cpl. Austin Oakley. "Here, they put you in situations you want to be wary of out in that open road."\n\n\n\n\n\nOakley said he recently returned to the United States from Japan, and he immediately jumped at the chance to buy a sport bike. He said it\'s not uncommon for Marines to have motorcycle clubs within their units.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We\'ll go out on rides together. Fridays for lunchtime, we\'ll all meet up and go to lunch," Oakley said. "When I get on my motorcycle, it\'s me and the motorcycle. I don\'t need to go fast. I don\'t need to do anything like that. It\'s just being free."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rise in motorcycle deaths isn\'t confined to Marines. The Navy says it\'s had 33 deaths on motorcycles over the past 12 months, a 65 percent jump from the previous time period. And authorities say motorcycle deaths have been a problem in the civilian world, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nMilitary officials say they\'re not sure why the deaths are on the rise. They initially believed that the accidents might involve mostly young Marines and sailors about 18 or 19 years old. But Navy statistics show that five of the victims were 25, the most prevalent of any age involved in the crashes. And two 40-year-old sailors were killed in motorcycle crashes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmos said the Marines have seen a similar trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he says the new training seems to be working: Of the 300 young men and women who have gone through the sport-bike course, only three have had accidents.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe safety course instructors said some Marines who go through the training decide the sport bike is not for them.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut even some Marines who\'ve survived past crashes still want to ride again, even after they get the new training.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I enjoy it," said Tucker.

{'text': '(CNN) -- In Mexico City, the government ran out of surgical masks after handing them out to one of every five residents.\n\n\n\n\n\nA mother and son wear face masks as protection from swine flu at Sydney international Airport in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nManufacturers and pharmacies in Europe are also reporting a surge in demand for face masks. And a Texas-based surgical mask producer says it\'s ramping up to meet demand and expects a shortage of masks.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut their real value seems to be in keeping people who are already ill from spreading the virus, rather than protecting healthy people, experts said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Richard Besser, acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Monday in a press briefing that the "evidence is not very strong" for masks\' value outside of health care settings, and outside of settings in which people come into face-to-face contact with a person with an infectious disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We would not recommend that people generally wear masks in their workplace as a precautionary measure," he said.  Watch for more on staying safe from swine flu »\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) also warns against relying on face masks, especially for those not infected with the virus.\n\n\n\n\n\n"They are mainly useful for people who are already sick, to prevent spreading. Not so much to stop people from catching the virus," Sarah Cumberland of the WHO told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Kingdom\'s Health Protection Agency also told CNN that the use of face masks was not necessary or recommended for protection against the swine flu virus.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it\'s not known for sure how much benefit a surgical mask has in preventing the transmission of swine flu, people who have the illness may consider wearing one as a way to reduce the amount they cough and sneeze onto others, said Dr. Arthur Reingold, head of the epidemiology division at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I think that this is a perfectly reasonable thing for someone with a respiratory illness to do," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore effective than soft surgical masks is the N95, which is an example of a "respirator." This kind of tight-fitting face covering protects people against breathing very small particles, which may contain viruses. The downside is that it\'s more expensive, uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time and has to be custom fit, Reingold said, so it\'s suited for people working in high-risk laboratories.\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks carry both physical and psychological benefits, said Dr. Julio Frenk, former health minister of Mexico and current dean of the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks are a "reminder to people that they should avoid close contact with other persons," he said. "They also have this effect of isolating people and reminding them that they should not be kissing people, shaking hands, things like that."\n\n\n\n\n\nFor health care workers, it\'s important to have high-efficiency masks, which protect better against infectious diseases, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut people in the United States should generally not have to wear masks because the cases are localized, he said. By contrast, it is more of a widespread problem in Mexico, especially in the capital city, a "huge urban conglomeration."\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasures such as closing schools are the most effective in stopping the spread of the disease, he said. Mexico\'s schools are closed until at least May 6.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy early Tuesday, the swine flu outbreak in Mexico was suspected in 152 deaths and more than 1,600 illnesses, the country\'s health minister said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSwine flu has reached  phase 4 (out of 6) on the pandemic scale, according to the WHO guidelines, but has not yet attained the status of global pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a flu pandemic, people should consider wearing a face mask if they are sick with the flu, live with someone who has the flu or need to be in a crowded place, the CDC Web site says.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are caring for a person thought to have pandemic flu or will be close to someone who may have it, consider a respirator, for example an N95 or high-filtering face piece respirator, the CDC Web site says. Some health care workers, such as nurses and doctors, use respirators when dealing with patients who have airborne diseases, the CDC said. iReport.com: Worried about swine flu?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the current swine flu situation, rather than masks, the CDC is pushing hand-washing, covering coughs and refraining from "giving somebody that little kiss of greeting," Besser said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"If you\'re in an infected area or if you have the swine flu, it\'s probably best not to, to not give a kiss, but we\'re not recommending an end of affection during the period. It\'s a period of time when we need a little more affection, but doing it in a way that isn\'t going to transmit a respiratory disease would be a CDC approach," he said.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What is the name of the more effective type of mask?', 'answers': ['N95,']}, {'question': 'What is in demand', 'answers': ['face masks.']}, {'question': 'What is unknown', 'answers': ['how much benefit a surgical mask has in preventing the transmission of swine flu,']}, {'question': 'Masks carry both physical and psychological what according to a doctor?', 'answers': ['benefits,']}, {'question': 'Manufacturers and pharmacies are reporting a surge in demand for what?', 'answers': ['face masks.']}]}

{'text': 'Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran\'s Bushehr nuclear power plant is just weeks from operating at full capacity, the country\'s top nuclear official said Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeireidoun Abbasi, the head of Iran\'s Atomic Energy Organization, also said Tehran has shown its new Iranian-made centrifuges to a representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bushehr plant, located along the Persian Gulf coast, will reach its full capacity of 1,000 megawatts by February 1, Abbasi said, according to the country\'s official news agency, IRNA.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plant was connected to the country\'s electric grid in September with a capacity of 60 megawatts. At 1,000 megawatts, Bushehr will be able to provide 2.5% of Iran\'s current electricity consumption, the IAEA said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbasi made the announcement about Bushehr while attending a meeting on Iran\'s nuclear achievements held in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told the meeting that Tehran had shown the new generation of its homemade centrifuge machines to the IAEA "in a bid to demonstrate the ability of Iranian scientists," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbasi said the centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium, were shown to the deputy of IAEA, Director-General Yukiya Amano, but he did not say when.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether an IAEA representative had in fact been to Iran and seen the centrifuges.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new centrifuges will enable Iran to enrich uranium over the current purity level of 5%, according to experts cited by the news agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nUranium enriched to between 3% and 5% is necessary to make fuel for reactors. Uranium enriched to 93.5% is considered weapons-grade.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe construction of Bushehr -- a civilian, not military, plant -- started in 1975 when Germany signed a contract with Iran. Germany, however, pulled out of the project following the 1979 revolution that created the current Islamic republic.\n\n\n\n\n\nIran then signed a deal with Russia in 1995, under which the plant was originally scheduled to be completed in 1999, but the project was delayed repeatedly. Bushehr finally opened in August 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States and other Western nations have expressed concerns that Iran\'s development of missile and nuclear fuel technology mean it is developing a nuclear program for military purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IAEA said in a November report that it has "serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions" to Iran\'s nuclear program. The agency said it has information indicating Iran has carried out "activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device."\n\n\n\n\n\nIran has denied such allegations, saying the Bushehr plant will be used only to generate electricity and operates under IAEA supervision.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the concern is not the Bushehr plant, but other nuclear facilities like Natanz, in the middle of the country; a facility at Qom, south of Tehran; "and other places where we believe they are conducting their weapons program."', 'qa': [{'question': 'When will the plant reach full capacity?', 'answers': ['just weeks from operating at', 'February 1,']}, {'question': 'Who believes that iran will be able to enrich uranium beyond 5% purity?', 'answers': ['Abbasi', 'experts cited by the news agency.']}, {'question': 'Did the IAEA representative confirm that they had seen the centrifuges?', 'answers': ['of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).', 'machines to the', 'shown the new generation of its homemade', 'Tehran', 'said Tehran has shown its new Iranian-made', 'to a']}, {'question': 'Who were shown the centrifuges?', 'answers': ['to a representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency', 'Yukiya Amano,', 'to a representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).']}, {'question': "What is Bushehr's plants full capacity?", 'answers': ['1,000 megawatts', "Iran's", 'of 1,000 megawatts']}, {'question': 'What is the full capacity of the plant?', 'answers': ['1,000 megawatts']}, {'question': 'What is considered to be weapons grade?', 'answers': ['Uranium enriched to 93.5%']}]}
{'text': 'ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- For Olympic swimmer Eric Shanteau, the last two months have been a whirlwind. "Full of the best moments and the scariest moments of my life," says the 24-year-old Olympic swimmer.\n\n\n\nEric Shanteau said he felt angry when he found out he had testicular cancer.\n\n\n\n"Getting to the Olympics was, has always been, my swimming dream since I was 8 or 9 years old. You know, right after I started swimming it was, \'I want to make an Olympic team. That\'s where I want to be\'."\n\n\n\nIn June, a week before the qualifying round of the Olympics he was told he had testicular cancer. "My initial reaction was probably anger more than anything else," he says. "I\'m used to being in control of everything. I\'m in control of how I train, how I race and then to all of a sudden have that control ripped away from me was tough."\n\n\n\nAfter weeks of tests to determine the "stage" or spread of the cancer, Shanteau\'s team of doctors cleared him to compete in the Beijing Olympics, which meant carefully monitoring his tumor but delaying treatment. Though putting off the surgery was controversial to some, Eric says it was an educated choice based on numerous doctor evaluations. "I hope people understand that if I was in a different position with my test results, then I wouldn\'t have put off having surgery."  Dr. Sanjay Gupta reports from Eric Shanteau\'s surgery »\n\n\n\nHe swam a personal best in the 200 meter breaststroke. He did not qualify for the finals.\n\n\n\nCancer was a motivator, he says, because he knew it meant he could be facing his last competition. He put everything he had into that heat. "Leave it all in the pool, and I don\'t look back and regret anything as far as how I raced."\n\n\n\nOnce back from Beijing, Shanteau invited CNN to spend time with him the night before his surgery in Atlanta, Georgia. Though admittedly a little scared, he spent the evening relaxing with his family, cooking dinner, walking the dog.\n\n\n\nA source of inspiration, he says, were fans who shared their stories of beating cancer.\n\n\n\n"They send me their story and it helps me to learn that people are going through the same thing I am all over the world," says Shanteau. "They all affect me in a different way and it\'s been really encouraging to share in this experience with other people."\n\n\n\nTesticular cancer is diagnosed in about 1 in 300 men in their lifetime. It is the most common form of cancer for 15- to 34-year-olds. It is also one of the most curable if discovered early. Nearly 140,000 men in the United States are testicular cancer survivors.\n\n\n\nShanteau says he experienced no symptoms of cancer and came across the tumor by chance. "I\'ve been in a Speedo half my life," he says. "So I am really comfortable with my body. One day I just felt something that wasn\'t suppose to be there. I decided to go and get it checked out."\n\n\n\nHe adds that although he had the "greatest excuse in the world" -- an Olympic dream -- to ignore the lump, he understood the importance of early detection. Shanteau\'s father Rick, is battling lung cancer and responding well to treatment.\n\n\n\n"A lot of guys, if they hear a rattle in their car, they\'re at the mechanic the next day," he says. "But if they feel something [physically] that they don\'t think should be there, it takes them a year to get to their doctor and that just is not smart. There\'s really no excuse, because it can save your life."\n\n\n\nFast forward to Shanteau\'s recent operation at Emory University Hospital. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta was with Shanteau during the surgery and spoke with the lead surgeon, Dr. Jeff Carney, moments afterward.\n\n\n\n"I think the operation went very well," Carney said. "Eric\'s a very healthy young man, very thin, in excellent shape.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A Colorado prosecutor Friday asked a judge to dismiss the first-degree murder charge against Tim Masters, who spent nine years in prison until new DNA evidence indicated someone else might have committed the crime.\n\n\n\nTim Masters, center, walks out of a Fort Collins, Colorado, courthouse Tuesday with his attorney David Wymore.\n\n\n\nCourt papers filed by District Attorney Larry Abrahamson cited "newly discovered" evidence, but took pains to state that evidence didn\'t clear Masters.\n\n\n\n"While the newly discovered DNA evidence does not exonerate Timothy Masters, it clearly warrants a complete re-examination of all the evidence related to the murder of Peggy Hettrick," the court papers state.\n\n\n\nThe motion seeks dismissal of the charges "in the interest of justice." It points out the DNA testing used to uncover the new evidence wasn\'t available when Masters was investigated and tried.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday a judge threw out Masters\' 1999 murder conviction, and he was freed -- also "in the interest of justice."\n\n\n\nAlthough the motion signals that Abrahamson is dropping the Masters case, he did not rule out future prosecution.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the prosecutor cautioned: "Contrary to news reports, the DNA testing results only suggest that there may be others, along with Timothy Masters, who should be investigated. These test results do not provide us with enough information to completely exonerate anyone."\n\n\n\nAbrahamson said he has asked Colorado Attorney General John Suthers to appoint a special prosecutor to continue the investigation of Hettrick\'s slaying.\n\n\n\nThe attorney general will announce his decision early next week, Abrahamson said.\n\n\n\nMasters, 36, has been investigated for Hettrick\'s  murder since he was 15. He has insisted he had nothing to do with her death, and no physical evidence ties him directly to the crime.  Watch Masters describe his anger at police »\n\n\n\nA jury convicted Masters 12 years after the discovery of Hettrick\'s stabbed and sexually mutilated corpse in a field near his trailer.\n\n\n\nAmong the evidence jurors considered were a collection of knives found in Master\'s bedroom, gruesome sketches and testimony from a prosecution expert that he fit the psychological profile of a killer.\n\n\n\nMasters\' defense team said he was framed, and that police and prosecutors sat on evidence that could have raised doubt about his guilt.\n\n\n\nThe significance of Friday\'s motion to dismiss is largely procedural, but Abrahamson indicated earlier this week that it might be unnecessary to try Masters again.\n\n\n\n"In light of newly discovered evidence revealed to me on Friday," Abrahamson said in a statement a week ago, "I will be moving as expeditiously as possible to make the determination of whether all charges against Timothy Masters will be dismissed."\n\n\n\nAbrahamson also has vowed to review all "contested convictions" in which advances in DNA testing may prove useful.\n\n\n\nHe said he wanted to examine the legal discovery process and that he had met with the Fort Collins police chief and his officers "to discuss the critical flow of information with assurance that all information is available to our office and the defense."\n\n\n\nSpecial prosecutor Don Quick filed a motion earlier this month citing four instances in which police and prosecutors should have handed over evidence to Masters\' original defense team.  See the key players in the case »\n\n\n\nAmong them was a police interview with a plastic surgeon who said it was improbable that a teen could have made the meticulous cuts necessary to remove Hettrick\'s body parts.\n\n\n\nAlso, according to Quick\'s motion, police failed to divulge that a renowned FBI profiler warned police that Masters\' penchant for doodling gruesome horror scenes did not tie him to the crime.\n\n\n\nInvestigations into how police and prosecutors handled the case continue.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Based on a true story, Cameron Crowe\'s "We Bought a Zoo" is the kind of real-life adventure tale with which anyone who has ever dreamed of truly making a new start can identify.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow often have you been looking for an apartment or a house, hoping to find that really cool, gothic deconsecrated church, cliff house with a widow\'s walk, Robin Hood-worthy treehouse or energy self-sufficient Hobbit hole? Whatever your dream fantasy home is, it never shows up on Craigslist, does it?\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, for Benjamin Mee and his two young children, the opportunity to make a fresh start shows up in the form of a slightly run-down farmhouse on 18 acres. It just happens to come with a rather down-on-its-luck zoo, complete with a depressed grizzly bear, an aging Bengal tiger, an African lion, porcupines, flamingos and even a binturong, a Southeast Asian mammal whose musk apparently smells like hot, buttered popcorn. Seriously.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the humans, Matt Damon does a great job as the grieving widower Benjamin, whose wife dies before the film begins. Benjamin and Katherine (Stephanie Szostak) had one of those storybook romances that we all wish we had (theirs is told completely in still photos and mostly dialogue-free scenes pulled from Benjamin\'s memory), and the pain is etched clearly on his face. His kids are all he has left, but much like George Clooney\'s Matt King in "The Descendants," Benjamin\'s parenting skills leave little to be desired.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou see, Benjamin was an adventure writer for a newspaper, the kind of a guy who voluntarily takes assignments that land him in a hurricane hunter airplane. Kids, on the other hand, can be way worse. Benjamin\'s son Dylan (ably played by Colin Ford) is less than happy about, well, everything. He\'s recently been expelled from school and his behavior (which includes drawing very disturbing pictures) is one big reason why Benjamin thinks they all need a fresh start. Dylan and Benjamin are constantly at each other\'s throats, and those scenes occasionally err on the side of strident.\n\n\n\n\n\nDylan\'s petulance and generally obnoxious behavior are really the film\'s only misstep. He\'s clearly a talented and smart kid, and his inevitable acceptance of his surroundings and new life come about 20 minutes too late. But it\'s a minor issue as far as the overall film is concerned.\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin\'s 7-year-old daughter, Rosie, on the other hand, is an absolute joy to watch. Played by Maggie Elizabeth Jones, Rosie lights up the screen every time she appears, and manages to overcome the potential "too cute, too precocious" pitfalls that so many adorable cinema tykes fall prey. Her sheer joy at the idea that the family has just bought a zoo is infectious. I dare you not to find her at least as adorable as the red fox or peacock chicks.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Benjamin buys it, the zoo is on its last legs. Kept together by a small but devoted staff, including head zookeeper Kelly Foster (a winning Scarlett Johansson), zookeeper Robin Jones (Patrick Fugit), who is rarely seen without a capuchin monkey on his shoulder, or Kelly\'s young cousin Lily (Elle Fanning), who takes an immediate shine to Dylan, and zoo architect Peter MacCready (played with fantastic drunken brio by Scottish actor Angus Macfadyen of "Braveheart").\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Haden Church does a spirited turn as Benjamin\'s levelheaded older brother, Duncan. Duncan is the voice of reason, pleading with Benjamin to do the sensible thing and cut bait when things get tough at the zoo.\n\n\n\n\n\nLily\'s fascination with Dylan and the evolution of that relationship is yet another winning ingredient in the film (written by Aline Brosh McKenna and Crowe). When Benjamin and Dylan finally get around to working out their differences, the talk they have about romance is one many of us could take to heart.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, this film is a little schmaltzy and sentimental. Yes, it is, at times, a little precious. And no, it doesn\'t break any ground. But it\'s genuinely funny, sweet and kindhearted, and it\'s going to make you feel good. Considering how stressful the holidays can be, what\'s so bad about that? This film is like an antidote to cynicism.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We Bought a Zoo" is exactly what it needs to be in this holiday season. I started smiling at the beginning, and kept a smile up until the end when, I\'ll confess, I was also shedding a few tears. Don\'t mistake this for frothy, insignificant throwaway entertainment. This one comes with real emotions that are thoughtfully and carefully presented. And, for better or worse, most of us can relate.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn extremely well-acted, well-written and entertaining way to spend a couple of hours, "We Bought a Zoo" is great counterprogramming to some of the heavier (but also excellent) end-of-year releases. However, I can\'t be responsible if you take the kids and, instead of asking for a puppy or a pony, they up the ante and start asking for an entire zoo.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We Bought a Zoo" is rated PG and contains a few mild (and cutely delivered) expletives.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What is the name of the film?', 'answers': ['"We Bought a Zoo"']}, {'question': 'What did the critic say the movie was?', 'answers': ['expletives', 'an antidote to cynicism.', 'rated PG and contains a few mild']}, {'question': 'Who plays Benjamin?', 'answers': ['Matt Damon']}, {'question': "He says it's great counterprogramming to", 'answers': ['some of the heavier (but also excellent) end-of-year releases.', 'heavier', 'end-of-year releases.']}, {'question': 'Matt Damon plays a widower in which film?', 'answers': ['"We Bought a Zoo"']}, {'question': 'Who plays the grieving widower Benjamin?', 'answers': ['Matt Damon']}, {'question': 'What does the critic say about the film?', 'answers': ['is a little schmaltzy and sentimental.', 'a little schmaltzy and sentimental.', 'this']}]}

{'text': '(CNN)  -- It\'s a trip that would make Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher blush. On Friday, the Carnival cruise ship Elation, sponsored by the world\'s largest nonprofit singles travel group, will make history by hosting the world\'s first International Cougar Cruise, and we don\'t mean the animal.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefined by the Urban Dictionary, a cougar is "an older woman who frequents clubs in order to score with a much younger man." It can be anyone from "an overly surgically altered wind tunnel victim, to an absolute sad and bloated old horn-meister."\n\n\n\n\n\n"A cougar is generally known as a woman over 40 who likes to date younger men, but theoretically any woman who dates younger men is a cougar," said Rich Gosse, who came up with the cougar cruise idea.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ship, which sets sail from San Diego, California, to Ensenada, Mexico, for three nights, is booked for 300 guests and even has a waiting list. The ship has three swimming pools, a seven-deck-high atrium, bar and grill, a Moroccan-inspired Casablanca Casino and a lounge that features stage shows, according to Ann Thomas, owner of the Singles Travel Company and organizer of the Cougar Cruise.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter making port in Ensenada, the cruise offers extracurricular activities like horseback riding, ATVing and other outdoor excursions.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There\'s at least four or five options a day for people to get together on the cruise. We\'re doing lots of activities; dancing, dining, Jacuzzi parties, karaoke for two hours. And starting at $125 a ticket, it\'s a great price," Thomas said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I\'ve had to hire two more people part-time just to pick up the phones," she said. "I\'ve never seen a response quite like this."\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas admits that she was hesitant to sign on to the idea but is glad she did.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We have people flying in from Italy and Denmark. My associates have been booking from France, Canada. It\'s fascinating," Thomas said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGosse, who has been hosting singles events for more than 30 years, said he got the idea after hosting a cougar convention in Palo Alto, California.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We had to turn away hundreds of people," Gosse said. "Then we did one in Beverly Hills and had a massive crowd down there, so I thought, maybe we should do a cougar cruise. I didn\'t think anyone would want to go. Needless to say, the phone is ringing off the hook."\n\n\n\n\n\nThese cougars may as well be an endangered species compared with those hunting them on this cruise.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The basic problem is, we have is too many cubs," Gosse said. "We usually have too many women and not enough guys, but there\'s been a paradigm shift in recent years, so now the cubs are more excited about it than the cougars."\n\n\n\n\n\nA "cub" is someone in their 20s or early 30s who likes to date older women, according to Gosse.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor years, he says, it\'s been socially acceptable for older men to date younger women. But in recent years, a phenomenon sparked by celebrities like Kutcher, baseball player Alex Rodriguez (who is said to have dated pop star Madonna) and others has led a new generation of younger men on the prowl for more experienced partners.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is even an ABC sitcom called "Cougar Town" that glamorizes the sexual escapades of a 40-something divorcee on a search for self-discovery by dating younger men.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Tim Robbins [and] Susan Sarandon was the first high-profile cougar-cub relationship," Gosse said of the actors, who have been together since the late 1980s. "Now we\'re seeing a paradigm shift where these younger guys are actively looking for older women."\n\n\n\n\n\n"If you look at the demographics, the only logical way for people to get their needs met is for younger men to date older women," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, for every 100 single women in their 20s in America, there are 118 single men in their 20s. The reason, Gosse said, is that young women are dating older guys.\n\n\n\n\n\n"When you\'re single, you always wish the person meets someone they want to be with. If this is something they want, then I wish them well," Thomas said.', 'qa': [{'question': 'when will the cruise for women sets sail?', 'answers': ['Friday,']}, {'question': 'What is the name of the cruise ship?', 'answers': ['Elation,']}, {'question': 'cruise is a symbol of which cougar movement?', 'answers': ["world's first International"]}, {'question': 'the event is fully booked by how many travelers?', 'answers': ['300', '300 guests']}, {'question': 'What is the name of the Carnival ship?', 'answers': ['Elation,']}, {'question': 'How many travelers are there?', 'answers': ['300']}, {'question': 'How many people have booked this cruise?', 'answers': ['even has a waiting list.', '300 guests']}]}
{'text': 'WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republicans reacted with surprise and recrimination Sunday to blistering criticism of the Iraq war from former coalition commander retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez.\n\nLawmakers lashed back at retired Gen. Ricardo Sanchez on Sunday after he criticized the war effort.\n\nOn Friday, Sanchez, who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004, called the Iraq war "a nightmare with no end in sight." He said the Bush administration, the State Department and Congress all share blame.\n\nSpeaking with military reporters in Virginia, Sanchez also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial, but the politicians have not been held accountable.\n\n"I\'m astounded, really," South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham on CNN\'s "Late Edition" with Wolf Blitzer on Sunday.\n\nGraham, who recently returned from Baghdad, said he and GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain had visited Sanchez several times in 2003 and 2004.\n\n"Every time we talked to Gen. Sanchez, we got pushback -- we have enough troops; Guard and reserves aren\'t being strained," Graham said.\n\nHe added that Sanchez\'s own record in Iraq is blemished: Abu Ghraib "got out of control under his watch. The war in general got out of control under his watch."\n\nBut Graham said that "finally," with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional U.S. troops since January, "We are getting it right."\n\nSanchez told reporters that American political leaders have cost American lives on the battlefield with their "lust for power."\n\nSanchez said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty, but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired.\n\n"While the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power, our soldiers die," he said.\n\nThat brought a tart response from McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\n"I wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time," McCain told CBS\'s "Face the Nation." He said Sanchez should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but "unfortunately, that doesn\'t happen very often."\n\nOne of the reasons few speak out, he said, is evidenced by what happened to former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki, McCain said. Shinseki was sidelined after telling Congress that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy Iraq.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, told ABC\'s "This Week" that Sanchez is simply wrong. "My definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror," he said. "I think we\'re making significant progress toward that end."\n\nBut, he added, "I think the central government in Iraq has been an embarrassment. They\'ve not been able to produce any of the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for."\n\nGraham said he hopes the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki will "step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year."\n\nIf that does not happen, he said, "it will be incumbent upon us, as a nation, to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable Iraq."\n\nThat brought a blistering response from Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under President Carter.\n\n"What is this? This is a colony," he said. "That\'s the heart and essence of the difficulties we encounter."\n\nEven those Iraqis who were happy to see Saddam Hussein toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing U.S. presence, Brzezinski said.\n\nThough some countries are willing to go along with the United States, "No one in the world really supports our policy in Iraq," he said.\n\nIn his Friday speech, Sanchez added that the "surge" of U.S. troops into Iraq represents "a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war."\n\nNational Security Council spokeswoman Kate Starr did not address the comment. Instead, she said, "We appreciate his service to the country. As Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker said, there\'s more work to be done but progress is being made in Iraq. And that\'s what we\'re focused on now."\n\nGen. David Petraeus is the U.S. top commander in Iraq. Ryan Crocker is the U.S. ambassador to Iraq.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Americans are spending less time stuck in traffic and wasting less gas, according to a new report.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericans spend a little less time in traffic, a study shows, but drivers on I-110 in Los Angeles might not notice.\n\n\n\n\n\nRising joblessness and stinging gas prices have put the brakes on worsening trends in traffic congestion, according to a study issued Wednesday by the Texas Transportation Institute, the nation\'s largest university-based transportation research facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It\'s temporary, but real," said institute spokesman Bernie Fette about the declines. "As goes the American economy, so goes traffic. There\'s fewer people going to work."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe institute attributed the changes to the recession, but the U.S. economy did not begin to slow significantly until the end of 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organization began tracking traffic trends in 1982, and by "every measure, congestion has increased substantially" in those 25 years, the latest Urban Mobility Report said. Not in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers surveyed 439 urban centers in the United States and found that travelers spent one hour less stuck in traffic in 2007 than they did in 2006 and wasted 1 gallon less of gasoline.\n\n\n\n\n\nCongestion delay per traveler in 1982 was 13.8 hours. In 2005, that number had almost tripled to 37.4 hours. But it was down to 36.1 hours in 2007, representing a "rare break in near-constant growth," the report said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the changes were nominal, most people may not have noticed any change in their commutes. The average person still needs 25 percent more time to travel during rush hour than during other parts of the day, Fette said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Things were so congested and bad, it was kind of hard to notice," Fette said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the report\'s other findings:\n\n\n\n\n\n• American travelers still wasted 4.2 billion hours stuck in rush-hour traffic jams. That amounts to nearly one full work (or vacation) week for every traveler.\n\n\n\n\n\n• The overall cost, based on wasted fuel and lost productivity, reached $87.3 billion in 2007, the report said. That\'s more than $750 per person.\n\n\n\n\n\n• The amount of wasted fuel, from sitting idle with the motor running, topped 2.8 billion gallons, or three weeks\' worth of gas, for every traveler.\n\n\n\n\n\nCongestion has slowed but, said the report\'s authors, that means only that things are getting worse slower, "hardly a positive goal statement."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Urban Mobility Report database includes a few similar periods from regional recessions in the past -- northeastern states in the early 1980s, Texas in the mid-1980s, California in the early 1990s. In every case, when the economy rebounded, so did the congestion problem, the report said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means congestion trends are likely to swing upward once the economy starts picking up.

{'text': 'Editor\'s note: CNN contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose current book is "When We Get to Surf City: A Journey Through America in Pursuit of Rock and Roll, Friendship, and Dreams."\n\n\n\n"Tumbling tumbleweeds" have been romanticized in song, but they\'re no fun in some parts of the U.S.\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- "Do we like them?"\n\n\n\nPatrick Victor, a game and fish commission employee in San Carlos, Arizona, repeated the question back to me as if I had proved my lunacy by asking it in the first place.\n\n\n\n"Do we like tumbleweeds?" he said. "No one likes them. They\'re not like in the cowboy movies. We consider them garbage -- worse than garbage. There is nothing to treasure or cherish about a tumbleweed."\n\n\n\nWe were talking about tumbleweeds because of a theory I had been pondering:\n\n\n\nIn this country, because of the immediacy of news, it seems as if everyone from one coast to the other is worrying obsessively about the same thing at the same time. You name it: the banking meltdown one day, the feared floods in Fargo, North Dakota, the next; the forced ouster of the head of General Motors one morning, followed soon after by the street demonstrations in London during the Group of 20 summit. We all tend to fret together about one crisis at a time; undoubtedly there will be something new for all of us to be nervous about together before sundown tonight.\n\n\n\nSo the goal here was to come up with something utterly unlikely -- something that, in 2009, you wouldn\'t think would bother people -- and find out if it does.\n\n\n\nTumbleweeds. That, just picked at random, was the test case.\n\n\n\n"They can be a pretty big problem out here," said Scott McGuire, a code enforcement inspector in Greeley, Colorado. "When the wind is right, they\'ll pile up right to the roofline of a house. Seriously -- people can\'t see out of their windows or even easily get out of their homes."\n\n\n\nThere was something instructive, even (in an off-kilter way) comforting, about learning this: the affirmation that, in this increasingly monolithic country, there are still local vexations that override the breaking news bulletins on the national networks, that people in one pocket of America are routinely dealing with forces that people a few hundred miles away are blissfully unaware of.\n\n\n\nJust hearing about it makes life seem somehow more life-size.\n\n\n\n"I meant what I said literally," McGuire said, continuing on his pinned-in-the-house-by-tumbleweeds theme. "They are big and prickly -- they can blow for hundreds of miles, sometimes all the way from Wyoming. They go until the wind dies out or they run into something. That\'s when people can have piles of them pressing against their homes -- when the tumbleweeds stop there."\n\n\n\nTumbleweeds, if you haven\'t thought about them in years, may seem like a gauzy memory from old Western movies, a nostalgic high-plains symbol of desolation and loneliness. There was that campfire song by Roy Rogers and his group, the Sons of the Pioneers; once you think of the lyrics and melody again, you can\'t get it out of your head:\n\n\n\n"See them tumbling down/Pledging their love to the ground/Lonely but free I\'ll be found/Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds."\n\n\n\nBut in the 21st century? In our connected-by-broadband, addicted-to-cell phones, technologically tethered nation?\n\n\n\nTumbleweeds? As something to be concerned about?\n\n\n\n"They\'re ugly and nasty," said Charlene Hardin, the county manager of Roosevelt County, New Mexico. "They can make our roads impassable. You can see 12-foot-high, chain-link fences with tumbleweeds piled all the way up to the top. They\'re very flammable -- toss a cigarette, and you have a big fire.\n\n\n\n"Tumbleweeds are more than a nuisance out here. We\'ll get complaints from people who can\'t even get out of their own driveways because the tumbleweeds have them hemmed in."\n\n\n\nTumbleweeds are mainly a plague in the West and Southwest: certainly not dire on the level of, say, a national security issue, but a perpetual pain in the neck. They\'re a gnarled and unpleasant-looking plant, useless as a crop or nutritionally; they dry up, separate from their roots and blow across the land, spreading seeds. They\'re thorny, are often painful to the touch and can grow as big as trash bags -- it\'s not uncommon to see tumbleweeds 4 feet in diameter rolling speedily along.\n\n\n\nAs Velda Bucklen, who lives west of Kersey, Colorado, and who was concerned about people just heaving errant tumbleweeds off their property and thus onto nearby lawns, wrote in a letter to the editor of her local newspaper: "They are prickly and strong. ... I have been guilty of tossing them into the street and sending them on their way. .... Please don\'t fight with your neighbors."\n\n\n\nThe people of the United States, though, are nothing if not resourceful. Just as you may have been unaware that tumbleweeds are a contemporary problem, so you may be heartened to learn that, as always, where some people see bad news, others see opportunity.\n\n\n\n"I thought there might be some money in tumbleweeds," said Linda Katz of Garden City, Kansas.\n\n\n\nShe was right. She runs a company called Prairie Tumbleweed Farm (its motto is "If they don\'t tumble, we don\'t sell them!"), and she said she has found a steady mail-order market for tumbleweeds.\n\n\n\n"Personally I\'m not fond of them, but apparently some people are," she said. "They\'re just big, rolling weeds. But people order them for wedding decorations. People order them for dances. Servicemen say tumbleweeds remind them of home. I\'ve taken two orders already today."\n\n\n\nFinding them is not a challenge: "They just roll by the house." She grabs them, puts them in boxes and mails them off. And, to answer your question before you can ask it: $25 for a large tumbleweed, $15 for a small.\n\n\n\nBefore we leave this topic so we can all return to more conventional news, a word from Bob Lee, director of weed and pest control in Cheyenne, Wyoming:\n\n\n\n"I\'ve seen people here who have gone away for a two-week vacation, and when they come back, there are so many tumbleweeds in front of their house that they have to chop their way to the front door."\n\n\n\nSo, Mr. Lee, is there one stirring and inspirational parting message you\'d like to convey to people?\n\n\n\n"Just that tumbleweeds don\'t have any redeeming features, as far as I\'m aware of."\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.', 'qa': [{'question': 'how much security has USA', 'answers': ['12-foot-high, chain-link fences']}, {'question': 'What dominates news?', 'answers': ['banking meltdown', 'Tumbleweeds,']}, {'question': 'What does Green say?', 'answers': ['"Tumbling tumbleweeds"', '"Just that tumbleweeds don\'t have any redeeming features, as far as I\'m aware of."']}, {'question': 'What dominates the new according to Bob Greene?', 'answers': ['Surf City: A Journey Through America', '"When We Get']}, {'question': 'What are some parts of the U.S. plagued by?', 'answers': ['Tumbleweeds', 'tumbleweeds"', '"Tumbling tumbleweeds"']}]}

{'text': 'L\'AQUILA, Italy (CNN) -- Leaders of both industrialized powers and emerging economies have agreed to work together on setting a goal to limit global warming to levels recommended by scientists, U.S. President Barack Obama said at the G-8 summit.\n\n\n\nG-8 leaders wait for an aide to remove toe markers as they pose for a family photo in L\'Aquila, Italy, on July 8.\n\n\n\nThe G-8 countries -- comprising the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and Russia -- agreed to a target of reducing their carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent by the year 2050 to try to prevent the Earth\'s atmosphere from warming by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), Obama said.\n\n\n\nThursday\'s meeting with emerging economies including China also secured a commitment from the developing countries to work for limiting global warming to the 2 degree Celsius threshold, Obama said.\n\n\n\n"Developing countries among us will promptly undertake actions whose projected effects on emissions represent a meaningful deviation from business as usual in the midterm, in the context of sustainable development, supported by financing, technology, and capacity-building," said the declaration from Thursday\'s Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate.\n\n\n\nThe declaration stopped short of setting targets for the developing nations. Obama said the emerging economies agreed to work toward setting specific targets.  Watch report from CNN\'s Ed Henry »\n\n\n\nHe called the commitment of the emerging economies "an important stride forward" in minimizing climate change, but acknowledged that the issue he called one of the most challenging of our times would be difficult to confront.\n\n\n\nEnvironment groups gave the announcement a cautious welcome. Joanne Green, head of policy at Cafod, told the Press Association: "Agreeing that average global temperatures should not rise by more than two degrees is forward movement but it is woefully inadequate compared to what was needed."\n\n\n\nAnd Oxfam spokesman Antonio Hill said: "Today 17 countries, responsible for more than 80 percent of the world\'s emissions, agreed for the first time that it\'d be nice to take the road which stops the planet heating up by more than 2 degrees.\n\n\n\n"While G-8 countries continue to speed in the opposite direction, towards a cooked planet and climate catastrophe, poor people want to know whether rich coutries will now actually turn around before it\'s too late."\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of climate change scientists warn that warming above the 2 degree Celsius threshold would mean potentially catastrophic impacts on Earth.\n\n\n\nU.N.-led negotiations on a new global climate change treaty are aiming to conclude with an agreement among 192 nations in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December. Obama said the G-8 targets and work with developing countries are intended to support the international climate change treaty that will succeed the Kyoto Protocol in 2012.\n\n\n\nIn the United States, Congress is debating a new energy policy that could codify the G-8 target for emissions reductions in law. A House bill that recently passed has the same target of an 80 percent reduction by 2050, but Senate passage of a measure remains uncertain.  Watch as leaders tour quake zone »\n\n\n\nRepublican opponents contend the United States would put itself at a competitive disadvantage by setting firm targets when China and other emerging economies would be free to pollute without limits. Some Democratic senators also fear harmful effects on fossil fuel industries in their states.\n\n\n\nThe Major Economies Forum led by Obama included the G-8 countries along with Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Australia, South Africa and others. The Forum nations account for 80 percent of the world\'s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n\nIts declaration Thursday outlined a range of actions including funding mechanisms for both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping nations and ecosystems adapt to global warming, along with more money to pursue alternative energy sources.\n\n\n\nThe declaration said the world\'s emissions should peak as soon as possible and then start going down. It acknowledged that industrial powers have emitted most of the pollution causing climate change and therefore have a greater responsibility in responding.\n\n\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced the creation of an institute to study and advance so-called clean coal technology intended to reduce the harmful pollution from coal-fired energy.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the declaration recognized "that the timeframe for peaking will be longer in developing countries, bearing in mind that social and economic development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities in developing countries and that low-carbon development is indispensable to sustainable development."  Watch what\'s on agenda at G-8 summit »\n\n\n\nTodd Stern, Obama\'s special envoy for climate change, noted that China and other emerging economies had never previously acknowledged the 2-degree Celsius threshold or committed to reducing emissions from current levels. He called those steps "significant," but conceded they fell short of binding commitments to meet specific reductions goals.\n\n\n\nHowever, Stern said the 2-degree threshold was the "underpinning" of the global goal for an overall 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, including the 80 percent cuts targeted by the G-8 countries.\n\n\n\nObama acknowledged the United States has previously failed to meet its responsibilities regarding climate change, and he pledged a renewed commitment and leadership. In his remarks, Rudd made a point of welcoming the new leadership role by Obama and the United States.\n\n\n\nObama will meet Friday with Pope Benedict XVI, who launched a verbal assault on global capitalism ahead of the G-8 meeting, lambasting "grave deviations and failures" and calling for a "profoundly new way of understanding business enterprise."\n\n\n\nThe pope challenged bankers to turn away from the practices blamed for bringing about the global economic crisis and instead use their power to help the world create wealth and economic development.\n\n\n\n"Above all, the intention to do good must not be considered incompatible with the effective capacity to produce goods," Benedict said Wednesday.\n\n\n\nAfter his meeting with the pope, the first U.S. African-American president will make his first trip as chief executive to Africa, traveling to Accra, Ghana.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Women in Somalia\'s third-largest city, Baidoa, have been ordered to wear Islamic dress starting this week or face jail time, according to a resident and Somali media reports.\n\n\n\n\n\nSomali women wait to get medicine at a clinic near Mogadishu in July.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe order -- issued last week by Al-Shabaab, the radical Islamist militia that controls the city -- also warns business owners to close their shops during daily prayers, or they will be temporarily shut down, a local journalist said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe militia has ordered women to cover their bodies and heads from view, according to a resident of Baidoa who did not want to be identified for security reasons. The clothing must be black, red or white, and women in the impoverished city are concerned that they will not be able to purchase clothing that conforms to the order, the resident said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said women would be jailed if they violated the order after it goes into effect Tuesday. Somalia\'s Shabelle Media, quoting an Al-Shabaab spokesman, said they would spend 12 hours in jail.\n\n\n\n\n\nShabelle points out that it is unclear how Al-Shabaab will enforce its order in Baidoa. The militia has issued similar edicts that failed to be carried out, according to Shabelle.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this edict could be bolstered by Somalia\'s parliament, which voted unanimously Saturday to allow sharia, or Islamic law, in the Horn of Africa country. Lawmakers hope to boost President Sharif Ahmed\'s efforts to defeat Al-Shabaab, which has vowed to fight the government until sharia is imposed in Somalia.\n\n\n\n\n\nSomali Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke told Voice of America that parliament\'s vote "removed any justifications for any opposition group ... to use Islam for political ends."\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are concerns that Islamic law, which has numerous interpretations and variations, could lead to government-sanctioned human rights abuses in Somalia. The strict interpretation of sharia forbids girls from attending school, requires veils for women and beards for men, and bans music and television.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, Al-Shabaab fighters patrolling the streets shot and killed a 20-year-old Somali man because he was not praying at the designated time, according to a local journalist who cannot be named for security reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\nSharmarke denied that the vote would open the door for a radical interpretation of Islamic law, such as that carried out by the Taliban in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n\n"People always think of the Taliban and Talibanization of a country. But that isn\'t the case," the prime minister said. "I think sharia in Somalia is part of the laws for thousands of years, and we never had this kind of a thing. Besides, it doesn\'t have to be that way, cutting hands."\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder some strict interpretations of sharia, a thief is punished by having a hand cut off.\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Shabaab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union, which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006.

{'text': 'WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Democrats\' top investigator in Congress reacted angrily Friday to a report that the former Blackwater USA employee accused of killing an Iraqi vice presidential guard was hired by another U.S. contractor weeks later.\n\nRep. Henry Waxman says the State Department is covering up "an epidemic of corruption" in Iraq.\n\nThe report comes alongside Rep. Henry Waxman\'s warning of a "confrontation" with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice over how much Americans should be able to learn about corruption in Iraq.\n\nIn a sharply worded letter,  Waxman demanded Rice turn over a long list of documents related to the contractor, Andrew Moonen.\n\n"Serious questions now exist about whether the State Department may have withheld from the U.S. Defense Department facts about this Blackwater contractor\'s shooting of the Iraqi guard that should have prevented his hiring to work on another contract in support of the Iraq War," wrote Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n\nMoonen is accused of fatally shooting an Iraqi guard and fleeing the scene, according to a Congressional memo describing the investigation report. He was fined, fired and flown home from Iraq, and the company later paid $20,000 in compensation to the victim\'s family.  Moonen returned to the United States within a few days of the incident, his attorney said, but in February he returned to Kuwait working for Combat Support Associates (CSA), a company spokesman said.\n\nCNN reported Thursday night that CSA said it was unaware of the December incident when it hired Moonen, because the State Department and Blackwater kept the incident quiet and out of Moonen\'s personnel records.  Waxman wrote it is "hard to reconcile this development" with previous assertions State Department officials have made in recent days.   Waxman earlier accused Rice and the State Department of a cover-up of what he called "an epidemic of corruption" in Iraq in general.\n\nHe branded the State Department\'s anti-corruption efforts "dysfunctional, under-funded and a low priority."\n\nWaxman further blasted the department for trying to keep secret details of corruption in Iraq, especially relating to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.\n\n"Corruption is increasing in Iraq, and the State Department can\'t keep us from knowing that -- can\'t censor that -- just because it might embarrass or hurt our relationship with [al-]Maliki," Waxman said at the House committee hearing.  Watch Waxman ask why negative comments must be said behind closed doors Â»\n\nDeputy Secretary of State Larry Butler repeatedly refused to answer questions from Waxman about Iraqi corruption but offered full disclosure if his testimony would be kept secret.\n\nAsked if he believes the Iraqi government has the political will or the capability to root out corruption, Butler responded, "Mr. Chairman, questions which go to the broad nature of our bilateral relationship with Iraq are best answered in a classified setting."\n\nBut he was more forthcoming when talking about efforts that al-Maliki has taken to improve matters, commending the prime minister for dispatching Iraqi forces to surround a refinery to ensure oil did not end up on the black market.\n\nBut Waxman appeared unmoved.\n\n"Why can you talk about the positive things and not the negative things?" he asked. "Shouldn\'t we have the whole picture?"\n\n"I\'d be very pleased to answer those questions in an appropriate setting," Butler replied.\n\nWaxman laughed and asked, "An appropriate setting for positive things is a congressional hearing, but for negative things, it must be behind closed doors?"\n\n"As you know, this goes to the very heart of diplomatic relations and national security," Butler said.\n\n"It goes to the very heart of propaganda," Waxman said, putting funding for anti-corruption activities through June 15, 2006, at $65 million, "or less than 0.003 percent of the total" spent by the Iraqi Relief and Reconstruction Fund.\n\nThe State Department said details of anti-corruption efforts must be secret to protect investigators and Iraqi allies.\n\nIn a letter to Rice last week, Waxman called the department\'s position "ludicrous."\n\nFellow Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky agreed. "It\'s pretty clear that the administration just wants to muzzle any comments that reflect negatively on the [al-]Maliki government," he said.\n\nEarlier, the former head of the Iraqi Commission on Public Integrity, Judge Radhi Hamza al-Radhi, told the hearing that al-Maliki had protected family members from corruption investigations, citing Salam al-Maliki, Iraq\'s former transportation minister and the prime minister\'s cousin.\n\nAl-Radhi resigned last month and fled Iraq after he and his family were attacked and 31 of his anti-corruption employees were killed. He said corruption has affected "virtually every agency and ministry, including some of the most powerful officials in Iraq."\n\n"Corruption has stopped possible advances by the government on the political level, on economic reconstruction, on basic services, amenities and infrastructure and on the rule of law," he told the committee, estimating the total lost to corruption at $18 billion.\n\nIn Baghdad, Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh acknowledged his country is plagued with a "high level" of corruption, but he said officials are trying to rein in the problem.\n\nU.S. Comptroller General David Walker, head of the Government Accountability Office, said there appeared to be no U.S. plan for countering the corruption. He urged Congress to consider conditioning future appropriations on such a plan "so we can achieve some results rather than have just more efforts."\n\nWaxman questioned whether Iraq\'s government was "too corrupt to succeed." If so, he added, "We need to ask if we could, in good conscience, continue to ... prop up his regime."

{'text': 'EVERETT, Washington (CNN) -- Meet Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAbraham Lincoln with his parents, Dean and Kryssia Lincoln, at their home in Everett, Washington.\n\nAbraham, 23, may not look like America\'s 16th president, but he is a distant relative -- and he uses "mrprez16" in his e-mail address.\n\n"I\'ve always joked [that] Dean, my father, looks like President Abraham Lincoln. It\'s through his bloodline that we\'re related."\n\nDean claims to be a third cousin five times removed.\n\n"There were three brothers that came to America from England in 1635," he says. "We\'re related to Samuel Lincoln, the same one Abraham Lincoln is related to."\n\n"I\'m tall and fairly thin," Dean adds. "He didn\'t have a moustache. If I shaved and grew a beard like him, I\'d probably look a lot like him."\n\nDean\'s son, Abraham, looks more like his mother.\n\n"I got the color of my skin from my mother, the Hispanic side," Abraham says. "I have the height from my dad, similar to Abraham Lincoln\'s height -- though not quite there, three inches shorter."  Watch Abraham Lincoln speak of his iconic namesake »\n\nKryssia, Abraham\'s mother, is from El Salvador.\n\n"I loved the name Abraham," she says. "I always did. I think it sounds so elegant and in Spanish, it\'s \'Aab-ra-haam\'. In the Bible, Abraham is the \'father of our faith.\' "\n\n"I never knew I was going to marry a man with the last name \'Lincoln,\' never dreamed about it. So when I got married (in 1982) to my husband, Dean Lincoln, and we had our second child, and it was a boy," she says, snapping her fingers, "sure enough, I wanted to name him Abraham.\n\n"We didn\'t have to argue very much because of course the heritage that he has ... and his great-grandfather\'s name was Abraham."  See photos of the Lincolns »\n\nAt the Lincolns\' home in Everett, Washington, the dining room table is full of genealogy lists, old family photos and letters, some dating back to the Civil War.\n\nDean carefully unfolds one of the letters. It\'s from William Lincoln, a Union soldier and Dean\'s great-great-great-grandfather.\n\n"The \'Rebs\' are getting just where ol\' Sherman wants them," William Lincoln wrote home to his wife. "He will rout them soon and drive them back to their holes."\n\n"We ain\'t heard from the election to any certainty yet. But the soldiers think, if Lincoln is elected, we have hopes of the war playing out."\n\nOf his famous name, Abraham says, "At first, people don\'t believe me. I usually have to pull out my driver\'s license. They\'ll usually crack a few jokes ... sort of breaks the ice."\n\n"Once in school, a teacher came to my name in roll call. He decided to stop the class and told me to \'make sure I never drive a Ford car.\' \'Don\'t ever let my wife convince me to go to a theater.\'\n\n"He asked if I knew John Wilkes Booth. Those are the most common ones. I think he was waiting to get a reaction outta me, but I told him that I\'d heard them before."\n\nWord spread quickly through his high school that this freshman wanted to be called "Mr. Prez." The nickname stuck. And because of his Hispanic roots, some of his classmates even called him "El Presidente."\n\n"I think I\'ve heard every one in the book. I still get a chuckle every time someone thinks they\'ve come up with a new one," Abraham says.\n\nAbraham grew up in Everett, where, coincidentally, the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln is based. When he was 16, the local newspaper asked if he would write a letter to crew members returning from a mission to Iraq.\n\nAbraham\'s letter read, in part:\n\n"Dear Lincoln crew,\n\n"My name is Abraham Lincoln. I want to thank you for making me proud to know that the men and women on board the Abraham Lincoln, a ship with the same name as me, are out there fighting as true American heroes."\n\nAt first, Abraham had no desire to walk in the shadow of such a great leader. Then, at the University of Washington, he took a political science class.\n\n"There was something about politics that drew me," he says. "I loved the history behind it. That\'s when I made up my own mind: That was the path I wanted to go."\n\nAbraham spent a semester in Washington, D.C., as an intern for former Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts. On his list of places to visit? The Lincoln Memorial and Ford\'s Theatre.\n\n"The whole atmosphere of that city, knowing someone I was related to, a descendant of mine, had such a huge impact and changed the world as we know it ... And to have a huge memorial dedicated to such a great president."\n\nThis past summer, Abraham married Jenae, whom he met as a church youth leader. He says she likes the history behind the name and the attention they receive.\n\nAbe is working as a paralegal. He wants to attend law school and -- you guessed it -- pursue a career in public service or politics.\n\n"If anything, President Abraham Lincoln is a great model to follow after. So if you have the name, might as well go down the same path."\n\nOf the similarities between Presidents Lincoln and Obama, Abraham says, "Lincoln came into office with a nation divided in the Civil War, and Obama is the first African-American president, hoping to transcend party lines dividing America."\n\nSince Abraham\'s birthday comes eight days after his famous namesake\'s, the Lincoln family will celebrate President Abraham Lincoln\'s 200th birthday together with their own son\'s birthday.\n\nMeanwhile, Dean is growing a beard again. Kryssia wants him to shave the mustache and don a suit to honor President Lincoln\'s birthday\n\nShe says of her son: "No, I don\'t think he looks like Abraham Lincoln, the president.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Iran\'s supreme leader on Sunday blasted U.S. plans to overhaul the setup for a missile defense shield in Europe, calling the Obama administration\'s intentions "anti-Iranian," state-run media reported.\n\n\n\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei says the U.S. president is following "anti-Islamic and anti-Iranian" policies.\n\n\n\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei also called Western concerns about Iran\'s nuclear ambitions -- which Tehran says are only for energy purposes -- "purely a fabrication by the United States," according to the Islamic Republic News Agency.\n\n\n\n"This is something that is in the doctrine of anti-Iranianism, since the policy and the 30-year-old history of the Islamic Republic has proven that Iran wants to live in peace and under the spirit of equality and fraternity, with its Muslim neighbors and the rest of the world," Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, President Obama said the United States is significantly overhauling Bush-era plans for a missile defense shield in Europe, based partly on the latest analysis of Iran\'s offensive capabilities.\n\n\n\nThe "new missile defense architecture in Europe" will be ready faster, work with existing technology and provide better missile defense than the program proposed by former President George W. Bush, Obama said.\n\n\n\nObama said the change of gears was based on an "updated intelligence assessment" about Iran\'s ability to hit Europe with missiles. The Islamic republic\'s "short- and medium-range" missiles pose the most current threat, he said, and "this new ballistic missile defense will best address" that threat.\n\n\n\nKhamenei, speaking on the first day of Eid al-Fitr, a festive end to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, countered by comparing Obama to his predecessor.\n\n\n\n"America, under its former president, spared no efforts against the Muslim world as well as against Iran," Khamenei said.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Clouds of black smoke from burning plastic hang over the sites of Nigeria\'s vast dumps, as tiny figures pick their way through slicks of oily water, past cracked PC monitors and television screens.\n\n\n\nToxins from dumped electronics in developing countries has been seen as a growing problem.\n\n\n\nBut it isn\'t just a cut from broken glass these mainly young scavengers are risking. Much of the discarded electronic kit contains tiny -- but valuable -- quantities of aluminum, copper, cadmium and other minerals, all of which can be sold on, if they can be recovered.\n\n\n\nHowever they also contain highly toxic materials, which have been linked to reproductive problems and cancers.\n\n\n\n"People living and working on and around the dump sites, many of whom are children, are exposed to a cocktail of dangerous chemicals that can cause severe damage to health, including cancer, damage to the nervous system and to brain development in children," Kim Schoppink, Toxics Campaigner at Greenpeace, told CNN.\n\n\n\n"The open burning creates even more hazardous chemicals among which are cancerous dioxins."\n\n\n\nNo studies have been done on the extent of the chemical pollution of such sites in Nigeria, but in 2008 a Greenpeace report on similar dumps in nearby Ghana confirmed that high levels of lead, phthalates and dioxins were present in soils and the water of a nearby lagoon.\n\n\n\nA Chinese academic report published in "Environmental Health Perspectives" in 2007 confirmed that children living in the same area had higher levels of toxic metals in their blood than other children living nearby.\n\n\n\nThere is increasing evidence that this new health and environment problem is arriving in shipping containers from Western countries. Nigeria is one of the principal global destinations for "e-waste" -- the catch-all term for discarded consumer electronics.\n\n\n\nSome of this may have been legitimately handed in to be recycled in an EU or U.S. city, but lax enforcement, vague legislation and a lack of political will has meant that it instead passes through a network of traders keen to profit from developing countries\' hunger for hi-tech and a burgeoning second hand market.\n\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations Environment Program around 20 to 50 million tons of e-waste are generated worldwide each year.\n\n\n\nIn 2008 a Greenpeace study, "Not in My Backyard", found that in Europe only 25 percent of the e-waste was recycled safely. In the U.S. it is only 20 percent and in developing countries it is less than one percent.\n\n\n\nExtrapolating out from these figures the report concluded that a massive 80 percent of e-waste generated worldwide is not properly recycled. Some is burnt in Western incinerators or buried in landfill sites.\n\n\n\nBut much is exported to developing countries including India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ghana. When it arrives, a further percentage may be repaired and sold on to populations desperate for affordable technology. But anything beyond the skills of local traders will end up dumped.\n\n\n\nIt\'s a profitable business, and is already attracting the attention of organized crime. A report issued by the United Nations in July said that the criminal gangs behind much of the drug trade in West Africa were becoming involved with e-waste trading.\n\n\n\nThe volume of material on the move is staggering. In 2005, more than 500 containers full of e-waste entered Nigerian ports every month, according to the Basel Action Network, a U.S. NGO campaigning on issues surrounding toxic waste.\n\n\n\nEach one contains 10 to 15 tons of e-waste, totaling 60,000 to 90,000 tons per year. These figures are likely to have increased in recent years.\n\n\n\nThere seems little doubt that much of this waste is finding its way to Africa from Western countries. The Basel Action Network and Dutch NGO Danwatch have traced equipment from Europe to Nigerian dumps and earlier this year Greenpeace placed a radio tracking device in a broken TV handed in for safe recycling in the UK, but followed it to a Nigerian market.\n\n\n\n"Greenpeace is disappointed especially by U.S. and EU authorities," said Schoppink.\n\n\n\n"It is toxic waste from the U.S. and EU countries that is causing serious environmental and health problems in Nigeria, a country without the means to deal with this problem.\n\n\n\n"The U.S. and EU must play the biggest role in stopping the spread of e-waste; they are most responsible for the problem and have the resources to tackle it. The export of e-waste from the EU is illegal under the Basel Convention and the Waste Shipment Directive, but the laws are not being sufficiently implemented. In the U.S., there is no such law banning this practice.\n\n\n\n"In Nigeria the government is talking about stopping imports, but there has been no progress on this to date."\n\n\n\nSigns of progress\n\n\n\nThere are calls from environmental groups likes Greenpeace for electronics producers to do more to phase out their use of hazardous substances, and there are some signs of progress.\n\n\n\nSeveral electronics companies already make products using fewer hazardous substances, and others, including Nokia, Philips and Samsung are setting up voluntary collection and recycling systems in countries where they are not legally obliged to. Apple claims its products are now almost entirely free of the worst toxic chemicals.\n\n\n\n"If producers continue to use hazardous chemicals in their electronics and to fail to take responsibility for the safe disposal of their products, e-waste will continue to be dumped in developing countries," said Schoppink.\n\n\n\n"The pollution and related health problems in countries where e-waste is dumped will increase massively as the amount of electronics used worldwide is growing exponentially and the number of countries used as dump sites will grow."\n\n\n\nBut while the developing world needs the U.S. and EU to take responsibility for their waste, it also needs their discarded computers to train and build a 21st century workforce.\n\n\n\n"Nobody is arguing that Africa should be denied access to computers," said Tony Roberts, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Computer Aid International, a charity licensed by the UK Environment Agency, which provides recycled computers to developing countries to improve education and healthcare.\n\n\n\n"Technical colleges and universities are always short of resources. It is, of course, essential to developing economies escaping poverty to have access to affordable modern technology."\n\n\n\nComputer Aid works to close the digital divide between the north and southern hemispheres and offers corporations, including Coca Cola, as well as individuals, a positive way of disposing of electronics. They also believe learning about responsibility for that technology is a crucial part of the exchange.\n\n\n\n"Computer Aid argues that, in addition to the PCs, it is essential to also build the skills, knowledge and operating capacity in every country to manage responsible re-use programs and environmentally sound end-of-life recycling."\n\n\n\nIn the end, this is about everyone involved -- particularly the developed nations -- taking responsibility for their waste.\n\n\n\n"It is clear that companies have a moral obligation to treat Africa in exactly the same way that they do, say, Germany," said Roberts.

Another has furniture attached to the ceiling, another has coffins for beds, and still another has lion cages on stilts (the Web site claims that kids "love to sleep" in them).

Now, after some creative recycling, it\'s guests rather than booze that mellow out inside the casks. The richly worn and airtight oak barrels have two narrow beds, with a small sitting area outside.

Inside, the walls seem to dissolve into the floor, and right angles are avoided entirely. Each guest room is built around a different animal theme: the Eagle Room has a big-beaked bird standing atop a huge egg, while another has arm-sized ants crawling up the wall.

You\'ll have to know how to scuba dive to reach your room, and guests without the mandatory certification must take a course at the hotel. Once you\'ve reached the lodge, which sleeps up to six, you\'ll be close to angelfish, anemones, barracuda, oysters, and other creatures -- each room is equipped with a 42-inch window, so you don\'t need to be suited up to keep an eye on the neighborhood. 305/451-2353, jul.com.\n\n\n\nCrash in a jet plane\n\n\n\nNear a beach that\'s within Manuel Antonio National Park, the Hotel Costa Verde doesn\'t lack for great sights.

The jet\'s interior was once able to hold up to 125 passengers, but there are few reminders left of its days in the service of South African Airways and Colombia\'s Avianca Airlines.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Spongy red balls wait in a queue, separating two teams wired to smack their opponent. Within seconds, the players dip and dive like dolphins until one player stands alone, relishing in victory.\n\n\n\nAn adult plays in a dodge ball league organized by the\n\nCity of Sparks Parks and Recreation in Nevada.\n\n\n\nIt\'s the classic game of dodge ball, but these aren\'t fifth-graders during PE class in Sparks, Nevada.\n\n\n\nThe childhood sport of dodge ball made a comeback four years ago in this bedroom community among adults in their 20s and 30s -- and even a few players who reached retirement.\n\n\n\nNow, hundreds of working professionals, doctors, lawyers and teachers congregate at the local recreation center for a dose of dodge ball on Sunday nights.\n\n\n\n"I think a lot of it goes back to trying to stay young," said Tony Pehle, recreation supervisor in Sparks, who started the dodge ball program after being inspired by the 2004 Ben Stiller movie "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story."\n\n\n\n"They might be adults, but they still like to play and have fun."\n\n\n\nHas Peter Pan syndrome come to stay? From playing dodge ball to jumping double Dutch and competing in rock-paper-scissors, adult men and women, from urban nests to rural towns, are reveling in games and activities once thought to be child\'s play.\n\n\n\nThe 2009 World Yo-Yo Contest in Orlando, Florida, this weekend (August 13)  is all grown up, attracting more than 150 adult competitors, who can showcase dizzying tricks with the flick of a finger. Later in the month, hundreds of adults outfitted in pirate and animal costumes will race their homebuilt vehicles for Oregon\'s annual Portland Adult Soapbox Derby, a crafty activity that began for youths in the 1930s.\n\n\n\n"Once a year, I get to build something for the kid in me," says Jason Hogue, a 41-year-old carpenter, who has participated in the race for eight years. Last year, he constructed a car shaped like a hammerhead shark. "We get to use our creativity and get excited with our friends."\n\n\n\nWhether they\'re done to seek refuge from the daily grind or to provide nostalgia for youthful days -- or they\'re a product of what some experts say is a generation that can\'t grow up -- these juvenile pastimes are getting more popular. For example, adult viewership of the Nickelodeon show "SpongeBob SquarePants" swelled by 51 percent from 1999 to 2009, officials say.\n\n\n\nThe World Adult Kickball Association, one of the largest kickball organizations, has spread its tentacles to 33 states as well a soldier division in Iraq. WAKA Kickball began as a casual game between a few young single friends in their 20s in Washington, D.C. Now, the games appeal to tens of thousands of adults, many of them yuppies wanting a quick escape from the stresses of their first 401(k), mortgage and job.\n\n\n\n"I played soccer growing up, and I like competition," says avid kickball player Marlon LeWinter, 28, of New York City. LeWinter, a public relations executive, usually plays the position of center with a bunch of producers, writers and analysts in their late 20s. They named their team Chipwich Nation after they scarfed down the cookies-and-ice cream treat at a bar after a game one night.\n\n\n\n"Sometimes when it\'s [the score] two to one in a kickball came, I get the jitters," he says.\n\n\n\nThe economic bind also creates a favorable environment for adults to latch onto simple children\'s games and sports. With players who are trapped in a world of layoffs and job freezes, these adult leagues, contests and tournaments are the equivalent of sandbox time for children. They can make new friends and go for a beer after the game. These activities are also budget-friendly, costing less than $100 to join for several months of play -- much less than a golf club membership.\n\n\n\nSince the recession, Duncan Toys, one of the biggest yo-yo manufacturers in the United States, has seen sales spike. A company official noticed many of the adults who purchased yo-yos tried to get the same models they owned as kids.\n\n\n\n"Nowadays, everything is taken so seriously that people revert to something like playing with a yo-yo," says Mike McBride, a 34-year-old multimedia designer who picked up the activity shortly after college. McBride, who will compete in the Orlando World Yo-Yo contest, says the activity helps him relieve stress. "There\'s no pressure."\n\n\n\nIn 2006, Christopher Noxon, in his book "Rejuvenile," explored why adults fancy childhood pursuits like kickball, cartoons and cupcakes. Beginning with Generation X adults in the 1990s, the group began to shift from the norms of the hierarchal corporate ladder, and the age of marriage began to steadily climb.\n\n\n\nSoon, juvenile activities that had been regarded as silly became hip. Quirky became cool, and more organized teams, groups and competitions for playground sports and childlike hobbies emerged.\n\n\n\n"Our whole idea of adulthood has changed," says Noxon. "We value flexibility and creativity, and these are things kids are good at. It\'s brought us back to what we had as children."\n\n\n\nBut it isn\'t just the younger generations that clutch leftovers from their youth or become interested in child-like activities. Grandparents in their 70s and 80s still collect roomfuls of model train sets, romanticizing the days when the only way to travel was by choo-choo. Women in their 40s acquire American Girl dolls that stir fond memories of reading the novels during childhood.\n\n\n\nPsychology experts say it shouldn\'t be a surprise that the affinity for childhood hobbies and activities extends across generations. After all, Americans have long had an obsession with youth. To be young is associated with being fun, vibrant and active.\n\n\n\nIn the Internet age, finding one\'s inner child has never been easier, with the proliferation of social networks such as Facebook or Web sites like Meetup.com, where users can create groups and meeting times for activities. On the site, groups of adults organize scavenger hunts in Atlanta, Georgia, and action figure discussions in New York City.\n\n\n\n"This is a generation of people who are far less homogenous and more niche-oriented," says Judith Sills, a clinical psychologist who works with young adults. "They can bond around their quirky differences.

{'text': '(CNN) -- We are losing in Afghanistan, on two fronts. The most important center of gravity of the conflict -- as the Taliban well recognizes -- is the American public. And now, most Americans are opposed to the war.\n\n\n\nFor years, Afghanistan was "the forgotten war," and when Americans started paying attention again -- roughly around the time of President Obama\'s inauguration -- what they saw was not a pretty sight: a corrupt Afghan government, a world-class drug trade, a resurgent Taliban and steadily rising U.S. casualties.\n\n\n\nMany surely thought: Didn\'t we win this war eight years ago?\n\n\n\nAmericans, of course, hate seeing the deaths of fellow citizens in combat, but even more they hate to see those deaths in the service of a war they believe they are either not winning or maybe even losing, which is one of the reasons why they largely turned against the Iraq war in 2006.\n\n\n\nWithin a couple of years, Iraq came back from the brink and started to turn around, after which the war there became largely a nonissue for most Americans. Similarly, the American public would be more likely to tolerate the losses of blood and treasure in Afghanistan if they saw real progress being made there. And right now, they don\'t.\n\n\n\nThe second front we\'re losing is the Afghans themselves, who are the United States\' center of gravity in the Afghan war. Eight years into this conflict, America and its NATO allies -- who are still looked on favorably by a majority of Afghans -- are not providing large swaths of the Afghan population with the most basic public good, which is security.\n\n\n\nIt\'s time to table fancy counterinsurgency doctrines about "connecting the Afghan people to the government" -- Afghans have never had, and don\'t expect much, in the way of services from their government, and it\'s time now to focus on something much more basic: security.\n\n\n\nThe last government to provide Afghans with real security was ... the Taliban. When they ruled the country before 9/11, security came at a tremendous price: a brutal, theocratic regime that bankrupted the country and was a pariah on the world stage.\n\n\n\nBut in the context of Afghan history, the Taliban bringing security was decisively important, since what had immediately preceded their iron rule was a nightmarish civil war during which you could be robbed or killed at will by gangs of roving ethnic and tribal militias.\n\n\n\nIt is has been a staple of Western political theory since the mid-17th century, when Hobbes wrote "Leviathan," that if the state does not provide security to its people, life will be "nasty, brutish and short." Hobbes wrote "Leviathan" in the shadow of the English Civil War, deriving from that bloody conflict the idea that the most important political good the state can deliver is security.\n\n\n\nThe United States relearned this lesson in Iraq with some success starting in 2007. But the U.S. seems to have developed instant amnesia about this issue in Afghanistan, where around 40 percent of the country was controlled by the Taliban or was at high risk for attacks by insurgents, according to a private assessment prepared by the Afghan military in April, which was obtained by CNN.\n\n\n\nA glaring symbol of the collapse of security in the country is the 300-mile Kabul-to-Kandahar highway, economically and politically the most important road in the country, which is now too dangerous to drive on.\n\n\n\nWho will then provide security? The Afghan army is relatively small and generally ineffective. The police are worse. The plans to ramp up the size and efficacy of those forces are, of course, a key part of the American exit strategy from the country. But that training mission is going to take years. Nor are NATO allies going to add significantly more troops. Indeed, a number of NATO countries are already heading to the exits.\n\n\n\nThat means that it now falls to the United States to do the heavy lifting in Afghanistan, and if Obama is serious about securing the country and rolling back the Taliban, he really doesn\'t have much choice but to put significant numbers of more troops on the ground. That way, he can start winning the war: win back the American public, roll back the Taliban -- who have melded ideologically and tactically with al Qaeda -- and provide real security to the Afghan people.\n\n\n\nSuch a ramp-up will have an additional benefit. In the larger war on al Qaeda and its allies, the center of gravity is the Pakistani public, military and government because it is in Pakistan where al Qaeda and its Taliban allies are headquartered. And in one of the most important strategic shifts since 9/11, the Pakistani military and government are now getting serious about wiping out large elements of the Taliban and allied groups on their territory and, most importantly, are doing it with the support of their population.\n\n\n\nNo longer are Pakistani military operations against militants in Swat and Waziristan seen by Pakistanis as "America\'s war": they are now seen as being in the vital interests of the Pakistani state because the Pakistani Taliban and other jihadist groups have made major strategic errors since early 2009, including marching close to Islamabad, attacking Pakistan\'s equivalent of the Pentagon and killing hundreds of Pakistani soldiers and policemen.\n\n\n\nThis new development is vitally important. Over the years, U.S. military commanders have often talked about hammer and anvil operations in eastern Afghanistan and western Pakistan that would bring an American hammer down on the militants based along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, who would then in turn be caught on a Pakistani anvil.\n\n\n\nIn reality, the American hammer was never large and the Pakistani anvil was never strong.\n\n\n\nBut the ongoing Pakistani military incursion into Waziristan, which was preceded by months of "softening up" operations with air strikes and artillery as well as a ramped-up American drone program aimed at al Qaeda and Taliban leaders there, is today setting the conditions for a real anvil.\n\n\n\nThe hammer must now be applied.\n\n\n\nArmed groups don\'t sue for peace when they believe they might have the upper hand, and right now, the Taliban feel that they are winning the war -- or at least not losing it, which for most insurgencies amounts to the same thing. If there is to be some kind of political reconciliation with elements of the Taliban, that will only come once they truly believe they have no prospect of military success.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, key roads, cities and towns in Afghanistan must also be secured. Without providing that security, as Hobbes wrote three and half centuries ago, governments of any kind will fail at their most basic task.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What does Obama have to do, according to Bergen?', 'answers': ['the heavy lifting in Afghanistan, and if', 'melded ideologically and tactically with al Qaeda -- and provide real security', 'the Afghan people.', 'much choice but', 'put significant numbers of more troops on the ground.

Benigno Aquino III.\n\n\n\nFuneral arrangements were being set up, Mislang said.

{'text': '(Mental Floss) -- If you think comic book characters do amazing things in comic books, you won\'t believe what they can do off the page.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor starters, Superman brought down the Ku Klux Klan, and Donald Duck raised ships from the ocean floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Superman defeats the Ku Klux Klan\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1940s, "The Adventures of Superman" was a radio sensation. Kids across the country huddled around their sets as the Man of Steel leapt off the page and over the airwaves. Although Superman had been fighting crime in print since 1938, the weekly audio episodes fleshed out his storyline even further.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was on the radio that Superman first faced kryptonite, met The Daily Planet reporter Jimmy Olsen, and became associated with "truth, justice, and the American way." So, it\'s no wonder that when a young writer and activist named Stetson Kennedy decided to expose the secrets of the Ku Klux Klan, he looked to a certain superhero for inspiration.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the post-World War II era, the Klan experienced a huge resurgence. Its membership was skyrocketing, and its political influence was increasing, so Kennedy went undercover to infiltrate the group. By regularly attending meetings, he became privy to the organization\'s secrets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when he took the information to local authorities, they had little interest in using it. The Klan had become so powerful and intimidating that police were hesitant to build a case against them.\n\n\n\n\n\nStruggling to make use of his findings, Kennedy approached the writers of the Superman radio serial. It was perfect timing. With the war over and the Nazis no longer a threat, the producers were looking for a new villain for Superman to fight. The KKK was a great fit for the role.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 16-episode series titled "Clan of the Fiery Cross," the writers pitted the Man of Steel against the men in white hoods. As the storyline progressed, the shows exposed many of the KKK\'s most guarded secrets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy revealing everything from code words to rituals, the program completely stripped the Klan of its mystique. Within two weeks of the broadcast, KKK recruitment was down. And by 1948, people were showing up to Klan rallies just to mock them.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Floss: 5 memorable moments in comic book censorship\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Donald Duck\'s scientific breakthrough\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1966, Danish engineer Karl Krøyer developed a method for raising sunken ships off the ocean floor by injecting them with polystyrene foam balls. However, when Krøyer tried to license his invention with the Dutch patent office, he was denied. Donald Duck had beaten him to the punch by 22 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, Krøyer\'s concept could be traced back to a Donald Duck comic conceived by Carl Barks. In addition to being the most celebrated artist of the Donald Duck comics, Barks was known for his scientific prowess.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo in a 1944 story, when Donald got a bump on his head that turned him into a genius, the duck managed to mumble, "If I mix CH2 [a methylene compound] with NH4 [ammonium] and boil the atoms in osmotic fog, I should get speckled nitrogen!"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it sounded like nonsense, it wasn\'t. In 1963, chemists P.P. Gaspar and G.S. Hammond wrote a technical article about methylene that included a reference to the Donald Duck story.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final paragraph read, "Among experiments which have not, to our knowledge, been carried out as yet is one of a most intriguing nature suggested in the literature of no less than 19 years ago."\n\n\n\n\n\nA footnote revealed that "literature" as the Donald Duck comic. It seems the web-footed children\'s hero had deduced the chemical intermediate long before it had been proven to exist.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Floss: Musicians performing on Sesame Street\n\n\n\n\n\nBut why were these top American chemists looking to comics for inspiration? Apparently, Dr. Gaspar had been a lifelong Donald Duck fan, and he\'d rediscovered Donald\'s early reference to methylene while collecting old copies of the classic adventures.\n\n\n\n\n\nGaspar never disclosed how much his work owed to Duckburg\'s most famous resident, but then again, how many scientists would confess that they used comic books to bolster their research?\n\n\n\n\n\n3. A Spider-Man villain keeps folks out of jail\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 1977 edition of Spider-Man, Peter Parker has the tables turned on him. The villain, Kingpin, tracks down Spidey using an electronic transmitter that he\'d fastened to the superhero\'s wrist. Although Kingpin loses in the end (he always does), one New Mexico judge saw beauty in his plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nInspired by the strip, Judge Jack Love turned to computer salesman Michael Goss and asked if he could create a similar device to keep track of crime suspects awaiting trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1983, Goss produced his first batch of electronic monitors. Authorities in Albuquerque then tested the devices on five offenders, using the gadgets as an alternative to incarceration.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the transmitters are a common sight in courtrooms across the country, usually in the form of electronic ankle bracelets. Most famously, Martha Stewart donned one while she was under house arrest in 2004. Perhaps she would have felt better knowing that the gadget had once nabbed Spider-Man, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Floss: Truth about lie detectors (and Wonder Woman)\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Captain Marvel Jr. saves the bad-hair day\n\n\n\n\n\nLike most American kids in the 1940s, Elvis Presley fantasized about growing up to be like his favorite comic book superheroes. But it turns out that The King might have been more interested in their fashion statements than their special powers.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring his early teen years, Elvis was obsessed with Captain Marvel Jr., known as "America\'s most famous boy hero." A younger version of Captain Marvel, the character sported an unusual hairstyle that featured a curly tuft of hair falling over the side of his forehead.\n\n\n\n\n\nSound familiar? When Elvis set out to conquer America with his rock \'n\' roll ways, he copied the \'do, thus making it one of the most famous hairstyles of the 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that wasn\'t all. Captain Marvel also gets credit for the short capes Elvis wore on the back of his jumpsuits, as well as The King\'s famous TCB logo, which bears a striking resemblance to Marvel\'s lightning bolt insignia.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, Elvis never tried to hide his love for the Captain. A copy of Captain Marvel Jr. No. 51 still sits in his preserved childhood bedroom in an apartment in Memphis, and his full comics collection remains intact in the attic at Graceland.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlus, the admiration was mutual.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Barack Obama has talked of ripping out the White House bowling alley and replacing it with a basketball court. The former reserve player for Punahou High School\'s 1979 state championship team brings an enthusiasm for pickup basketball games to a place where golf, baseball and football have been the most-discussed sports.\n\nReggie Miller says he\'d pick Barack Obama for his squad because he likes the president-elect\'s team approach.\n\nAnd if he puts hoops in the White House, Reggie Miller, the retired basketball star and sports broadcaster, wants in.\n\n"I would love to be the first to go there and play," said Miller, whose record-breaking 2,560 three-pointers with the Indiana Pacers electrified basketball fans. Today Miller, 43, is an NBA analyst for TNT, which is owned by Turner Broadcasting, parent company of CNN.\n\nMiller and others have said Obama\'s playing style yields clues to the type of president he will be. Miller, who said he backed Obama in the election, spoke Monday to CNN.com. iReport.com: What would you like to ask Obama?\n\nCNN: Do you know Barack Obama?\n\nReggie Miller: I have never met him personally, but from afar, obviously I admire the man and the courage and the strength, the wisdom. I respect how much of a family man he is.\n\nCNN: Where does basketball fit in your view of Barack Obama?\n\nMiller: It seems like he has a regular pickup game, which I like because as a ballplayer, you like to do the same routine. ... He plays with the same guys, he likes to get a good sweat in. ... When you get a good workout in, you feel good for the rest of the day. It helps clear the mind.\n\nCNN: He\'s a left-hander; he likes to fake right and go to the left?\n\nMiller: I\'ve seen clips of his Punahou [high school] days, when he played in Hawaii, and I saw that HBO special with Bryant Gumbel when they had that informal game. ... He is a point guard, and most point guards are right-handed, so it would be definitely be difficult to guard a point guard that was left-handed.\n\nAnd in that [HBO] clip, I loved his decision-making, because it looked like he tried to get everyone involved, until it was game point and it was tied up.\n\nObviously, the commander in chief decides the game [Obama made the winning shot], and I like it. I think that trickles down into, you let your colonels, your generals do all the little work, but when it\'s time to make the big decision and win the game -- then it\'s the commander in chief, top dog, numero uno.\n\nBut I will say this, if I was playing against him in a pickup game, I would definitely force him right because it looks like he loves to go left.\n\nCNN: Does he remind you of anyone you played against?\n\nMiller: Well, it\'s funny because you don\'t play against a lot of left-handed point guards. Greg Anthony of the Knicks, a left-handed point guard from UNLV. ... [Nate] "Tiny" Archibald, I believe he was left-handed as well.\n\nCNN: From what you\'ve seen, how good a player is Obama?\n\nMiller: I would not mind picking him up on my squad; if there were 10 guys and we had to pick, he could definitely be in my squad. Because he knows what his strength is -- making sure that everyone gets involved, and that\'s the kind of point guard I want. Those are guys like Magic Johnson, Mark Jackson, John Stockton, it\'s not all about them; it\'s about let\'s make sure our team is good. He\'s going to get the ball to everyone.\n\nCNN: Speaking of being commander in chief, what are the lessons that you take away from Obama\'s basketball that you think would be useful?\n\nMiller: If you look at his demeanor, he\'s very cool; you have to be cool under pressure. You can\'t make hasty decisions. You\'ve got to look at the full picture as a whole and then you assess it. And I think from a strategic and a political standpoint, I think that very much sums up Mr. Obama.\n\nYou look at him during the debate and during the campaign, he pretty much never got too high and never got too low; he just kind of stayed right in the middle. When you\'re making the decisions that he\'s going to be making, for our economy, for Iraq, Afghanistan, you want someone who\'s levelheaded who\'s going to look at the big picture, who\'s going to rely on his Cabinet, which would be the other players.\n\nYou want them to all be on same page, which you want your starting five to be, and then you go out there and execute it.\n\nCNN: You think he\'s going to have an impact on the sport of basketball by example?\n\nMiller: It\'s not just basketball, I think sports in general. You know he\'s already said yes, "I think we should have a BCS" [playoff system for deciding the nation\'s college football championship], and I think everyone agrees with him. I think his love of basketball is only going to help the high school, collegiate and professional ranks. ... For sports in general, it\'s good to have a person in the White House who\'s physically fit, who loves sports but also understands and knows how to run a country.\n\nCNN: In that order?\n\nMiller: I don\'t know about that order. I think I would probably start with running the country first. I think what we do is more entertainment and letting people escape. I think running the country is a little more important than worrying about the BCS title game.\n\nI think getting jobs is probably first and foremost and getting our economy straight and getting our troops home, I think those are the most important things for the president-elect.

{'text': 'Los Angeles (CNN) -- The defense anesthesiology expert in the trial of Michael Jackson\'s doctor was found in contempt of court Wednesday for referring to his private talks with Dr. Conrad Murray during his testimony.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Murray did not testify in his own defense in his involuntary manslaughter trial and the judge refused to allow Dr. Paul White to base any of his testimony on anything other than what Murray told police.\n\n\n\n\n\nLos Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor gave Dr. White 30 days to pay a $250 fine, but he also dropped a second contempt citation for derogatory comments he allegedly made about a rival witness.\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday\'s contempt hearing was part of the aftermath of Dr. Murray\'s involuntary manslaughter that ended with a guilty verdict last week.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother contempt hearing is set for November 29, the day Murray is set to be sentenced, for one of the defense lawyers who allegedly violated the judge\'s gag order by speaking to NBC\'s "Today Show" during the trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nMurray defense lawyer Michael Flanagan, who was in court to defend Dr. White Wednesday, said after the hearing that he believed Murray should be eligible for early release if he is given prison time.\n\n\n\n\n\nA California law that took effect last month provides for non-violent state inmates to be assigned to county jails to relieve state prison overcrowding. The Los Angeles County jail has a court-ordered early release program to relieve overcrowding, which allows non-violent offenders to serve much of their sentences at home with electronic monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlanagan said Murray is not a safety threat to the public and should be included in the early release program.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. White told reporters after the hearing that he still believed Jackson gave himself the overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol and a sedative the coroner ruled killed the pop icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I was aware that Michael Jackson had self-administered drugs in the past, propofol specifically, and so what\'s to say that he wouldn\'t do it again," White said. "He was desperate. Murray was withholding from him the drug that he desperately desired."\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite, while under cross-examination by Deputy District Attorney David Walgren, referred several times to his private discussions with Dr. Murray about what happened the day Jackson died. Judge Pastor repeatedly warned him not to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the judge cited White for contempt and set Wednesday\'s hearing to decide if he would be fined.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There wasn\'t any intentional deception here or violation of the court order," defense lawyer Michael Flanagan told Pastor Wednesday. "He was explaining to Mr. Walgren \'Hey, I can\'t answer that.\'"\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor Walgren, who has grown a beard since the televised trial ended, told the judge that this was one of "multiple instances" where Dr. White was "trying to sabotage the trial."\n\n\n\n\n\n"It was intentional and deliberate," Walgren said. "It was an attempt to deny the people a fair trial."\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite told the judge he "did my best as I was admonished by you to answer question truthfully and as completely as I could."\n\n\n\n\n\n"I apologize profusely if I disrespected you," White said. "I learned a lot from this experience."\n\n\n\n\n\nPastor ruled that White was guilty of violating his order by giving "a non-responsive answer" that dealt with "no-go territory."\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile he could have fined him $1,000, he only imposed a $250 fine.

{'text': '(CNN) -- It was just after midday on a cold December Monday in South Korea\'s capital when news of Kim Jong Il\'s death filtered through.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough the reclusive North Korean leader had been plagued with health problems in recent years, the announcement was greeted with general astonishment in Seoul, according to a journalist from the country\'s largest newspaper.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The initial reaction was shock, quickly followed by speculation about what was going to happen next," said Woosuk Ken Choi, assistant editor with The Chosun Daily.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor its part, the South Korean military responded by raising its alert level, while the country\'s media went into overdrive trying to predict how this oblique and erratic state would respond.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Choi said most ordinary Koreans were remaining calm.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Korea: Should we fear change?\n\n\n\n\n\n"There was no rush to supermarkets to buy up food," he said in an interview with CNN. "The South Korean public seems confident that the country will be able to manage this. Many see the North Koreans as like us, people we need to care for and help."\n\n\n\n\n\nOutright conflict is not something many would expect, he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There is a little tradition in Korea that when someone passes away in a family you stop fighting.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We\'re on high alert not because we want to do something but because some renegade North Korean unit might cause some trouble. But no one really thinks the North Koreans will launch an attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Nothing happened in 1994 when Kim Il Sung died and it will be the same this time."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe architect of what became known as the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea in 1948 after the Korean peninsula was divided between U.S. and Soviet occupation forces, Kim Il Sung was an autocratic leader who presided over a policy of Juche, or self-reliance, which did much to foster the Communist country\'s isolation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Kim Jong Il, his oldest son, succeeded him, North Korea was crippled economically, having lost one of its main trading partners when the Soviet Union collapsed. Kim largely ignored the massive problems at home and focused on shoring up the regime\'s position and investing in the military as a bulwark against the wealthy, U.S.-backed south.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat military hardware does North Korea have?\n\n\n\n\n\nBut with Kim dead, Choi believes many in the south will see this as an opportunity to improve relations with their dysfunctional neighbor, perhaps even paving the way for reunification.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Most people, whether left or right on the political spectrum, hope this is the case," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"However a large chunk of South Koreans do worry about the financial burden of reunification, citing the case of West and East Germany in the early 1990s.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Others argue the cost of living together will be a lot less than living separately in the long run. I also believe a whole host of issues could be resolved with reunification."\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Choi said each generation in South Korea has its own viewpoint when it comes to relations with the north.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Those in their teens and 20s have a real fear of military conflict, as they are the ones who have to complete their compulsory military service," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Many people in their 30s and 40s worry about the financial cost to them of reunification, while those in their 50s and 60s back a united Korea whatever the cost."\n\n\n\n\n\nIf reunification is a pipe dream for now, Choi says there is a difference of opinion in South Korea about the dynastic succession in the north.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Many people believe the transfer of power to a third generation is absurd, totally anachronistic and not what the world is about today," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"But those who believe in a policy of engagement with North Korea say it doesn\'t matter whether it is third or fourth generation, they\'re still our people and we need to talk to them to try and resolve the situation."\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view, according to Choi, is "the Great Successor" will not last long.\n\n\n\n\n\n"He\'s simply too young," he said. Kim Jong Un is believed to be in his late 20s.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There is this notion in Korean society -- north and south -- that if you take the throne too young you won\'t last long. No matter how good he is, they think his uncles and more experienced family members will rule from behind him and that he could ultimately be sacrificed."\n\n\n\n\n\nAs pictures of ordinary North Koreans mourning the loss of their Dear Leader continued to filter onto television screens across South Korea Tuesday, Choi felt most people would have been struck by how staged they seemed.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The pictures don\'t reflect the reality in North Korea," he argued.\n\n\n\n\n\n"When Kim Il Sung died there were a number of people who really went out and cried because they really did respect him.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Kim Jong Il\'s case is different because about two or three million people died of starvation after he came to power. The level of mourning will be about a tenth of what it was in 1994.

{'text': 'London, England (CNN) -- A number of Latin American countries have rushed to offer their support to Argentina in its long-running territorial dispute with Britain over the Falkland Islands.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week Britain began drilling for oil in the waters off the archipelago, despite opposition from Buenos Aires which claims sovereignty over the islands it calls Las Malvinas.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project has reignited tensions between the two countries, who fought a brief war over the islands in 1982, with Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner accusing London of ignoring international law.\n\n\n\n\n\nArgentina says the natural resources around the islands, which lie in the South Atlantic Ocean off the Argentinean coast, should be protected, and Britain must accept international resolutions labeling the Falklands a disputed area.\n\n\n\n\n\nMexico\'s President Felipe Calderon weighed into the dispute late Monday when he said a number of countries in the region had drafted a document in support of their South American neighbor.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a summit of Latin American leaders in the Mexican resort of Playa Del Carmen, Calderon claimed Ecuador, Chile, Guatemala, Bolivia and Venezuela had all backed Argentina\'s opposition to the drilling.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We have approved a declaration in which leaders of countries and governments present here reaffirm their support for the Republic of Argentina\'s legitimate rights in its sovereignty dispute with the United Kingdom," he said in a statement issued by Argentine officials.\n\n\n\n\n\nEcuador\'s President Rafael Correa offered his country\'s "unconditional support" to Argentina, while his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet said, "We not only support our sister republic\'s claims to the Malvinas islands but every year we present its case to the United Nations\' Special Committee on Decolonization."\n\n\n\n\n\nVenezuela\'s outspoken leader Hugo Chavez also reiterated his support for Argentina. "We support unconditionally the Argentine government and the Argentine people in their complaints," Chavez told reporters Tuesday, according to Reuters.com. "That sea and that land belongs to Argentina and to Latin America."\n\n\n\n\n\nA day earlier, Chavez had used his weekly televised address to make a direct appeal to Britain\'s Queen Elizabeth II. "Look, England, how long are you going to be in Las Malvinas? Queen of England, I\'m talking to you," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The time for empires are over, haven\'t you noticed? Return the Malvinas to the Argentine people."\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, British oil and gas exploration company Desire Petroleum announced that its Ocean Guardian rig had started drilling an exploration well in the North Falkland Basin, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of the islands.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesire estimates that the North Falkland Basin could contain 3.5 billion barrels of oil as well as having "significant gas potential." The exploratory drilling is expected to last around 30 days, a spokesman for the company told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the prospect of Britain making a highly lucrative discovery in region has infuriated Buenos Aires.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has to do with the defense of the interests of Argentineans, not just about sovereignty," Argentine Cabinet Chief Anibal Fernandez said last week, adding that Argentina lays claim not just to the islands, but to any resources that could be found there.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement last week, the Falkland Islands government, which represents its 2,500 residents, said it had "every right to develop a hydrocarbons industry within our waters."\n\n\n\n\n\n"The British government has clearly stated that they support our right to develop legitimate business," it said.

{'text': 'Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- South Sudan\'s government has gained control of a remote town that had been under attack by fighters from a rival tribe, the nation\'s information minister said Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the thousands who fled into the bush have begun to return to Pibor, said Barnaba Benjamin, South Sudan\'s minister of information and broadcasting.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier Monday, a military official said that roughly 4,000 army and police reinforcements were on the way to Pibor after weekend attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations also said it sent a battalion of peacekeepers to Pibor last week amid reports that members of the Lou Nuer tribe were marching toward the town, home to the Murle tribe, after attacking the village of Lukangol.\n\n\n\n\n\nEthnic tensions in the South Sudan state of Jonglei have flared as tribes fight over grazing lands and water rights, disagreements that have dissolved into cattle raids and abduction of women and children.\n\n\n\n\n\nFighters first struck Pibor on Saturday, attacking a portion that was out of the reach of U.N. peacekeepers, said Col. Philip Auger of the South Sudan army.\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin said there were no casualties and no direct confrontation between the two tribes there, because most of the Murle had fled when they heard the Lou Nuer were approaching.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nonprofit group Medecins sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, was still trying Monday to reach 117 of its 130 aid workers who fled into the bush along with the populations of Pibor and Lukangol before the attack, said Sarathy Rajendran, head of the group\'s South Sudan mission.\n\n\n\n\n\nRajendran said the organization was afraid for its workers\' safety and "very concerned" for the people of Pibor and Lukangol.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We believe tens of thousands are currently displaced without access to water, food and health care," he said.

{'text': 'LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- Angry protests are a common sight in Pakistan. Crowds often gather to denounce the United States or the Pakistani government, which critics accuse of being an American puppet.\n\n\n\n\n\nAntiTaliban protesters in Lahore.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore this week, several hundred protesters gathered on a scorching day to take on a very different target: the Taliban.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I will fight them to my last breath and the last drop of my blood in my body. I\'m not scared," vowed newspaper publisher Jugnu Mohsin.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was leading a crowd of several hundred students, artists, writers and others, chanting "the Taliban is the enemy of Islam" in Urdu.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic protests against the Taliban started cropping up in various Pakistani cities after a video emerged showing militants publicly flogging a teenage girl. The Taliban\'s recent declaration that the Pakistani government and judicial system are "unIslamic" has also outraged many educated Pakistanis.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeha Mehdi moved to Lahore to study. Now, she fears her way of life is being threatened by the Taliban.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I cannot give up my education, and I cannot give up the way I\'m living," the 23-year-old student said. "These Talibans have ruined the reputation of Islam."\n\n\n\n\n\n"There were threats here also from the Taliban that if we gather they might just bomb us," Mehdi said.  Watch how the anti-Taliban movement is growing »\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 250 miles away, Pakistan\'s military continued its assault against Taliban militants who want to impose a radical interpretation of Islamic law in the country\'s northwestern tribal regions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPakistan\'s government recently signed a deal that would allow Islamic law, or sharia, in the tribal belt as long as the law was imposed in accordance with the country\'s constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\nMehdi and others in Lahore fear that the Taliban\'s version of sharia -- which forbids girls from attending school, as well as music, poetry and dance -- is slowly creeping into Lahore, the center of Pakistani culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Our way of life is being threatened," said Kamiar Rokni, a fashion designer who took part in the protest. "And if we don\'t do anything about it, then you\'re just going to be sitting around and one day the way you live and what this country\'s all about is going to stand for nothing."\n\n\n\n\n\nRokni said he fears the Taliban "want to change the way we exist."\n\n\n\n\n\nLahore may be hundreds of miles away from the Taliban-held areas outside Islamabad, but it is no stranger to militant attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Last year we lost 39 people in acts of terrorism and this year we have lost 17 people in Lahore alone," Lahore police Chief Parvez Rathore said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs he speaks, a heavily armed escort is one step behind the police chief even as he walks outside the walls of the city\'s police headquarters.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March, gunmen attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lankan national cricket team in Lahore, killing six Pakistani police officers and the team\'s driver.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeeks later, militants dressed in police uniforms stormed a police training center in the city, prompting an eight-hour stand-off with police. Eight cadets were killed during the March 30 siege, which the government blamed on Pakistan\'s Taliban.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice in Lahore said the attacks would not have been possible without local support. Residents say there is no doubt that the Taliban have support in Pakistan\'s second largest city.\n\n\n\n\n\n"They\'re here in Lahore, this is the thing," said Jamal Rahman, who plays guitar for the Lahore-based band, "Lal" which means "Red."\n\n\n\n\n\n"Little groups of the Taliban are going around and intimidating people, causing fear, telling women to cover up and if they don\'t they\'ll shoot them."\n\n\n\n\n\nRahman and his cousin, Aider -- who plays flute for "Lal" -- are using their music to rally society against what he says is a growing threat by the Taliban.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We want to try to get people aware, and try to get people activated and motivated to fight against this militancy," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is unclear if the protests and rallying cries from Rahman and the others in Lahore are the start of a mass movement or simply the swan song of Pakistan\'s wealthy, urban elite who could be the first to leave if the suicide bombers and insurgents succeed in further destabilizing the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nEither way, their message is a sign that more Pakistanis believe the Taliban\'s threat is directed at them, and not just a reaction to the so-called U.S.-led "war on terror."\n\n\n\n\n\nMehdi said she fears her life as a student could come to a violent end if the people of Lahore do not stand up to Islamic extremists.\n\n\n\n\n\n"If the Taliban take over then I\'ll be on the road being flogged by one of them like they did in Swat and I don\'t want that," she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Pakistanis are resorting to violence to defend their turf.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 30 people were killed in the southern port city of Karachi this week as members of the city\'s Mahajir ethnic majority group engaged in deadly clashes with ethnic Pashtuns. The Taliban is a mostly Pashtun movement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government in Karachi has issued a "shoot on sight" order to security forces, to try to maintain calm in the city.\n\n\n\n\n\nA week before the clashes erupted, a leader of the MQM political party, which represents the Mahajir community in Karachi, said his supporters would fight back against what he called the "Talibanization" of his city.\n\n\n\n\n\n"You have to take the nasty decisions now," Haider Abbas Rizvi told CNN last week.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Fans of the character Easy Rawlins don\'t want to hear it, but author Walter Mosley says he has officially moved on.\n\nAuthor Walter Mosley found fame with his Easy Rawlins mysteries and has debuted a new series.\n\nThe prolific writer seemingly wrapped up his beloved series -- which spawned the 1995 film "Devil in a Blue Dress" starring Denzel Washington -- in 2007 with the 10th Easy Rawlins mystery, "Blonde Faith."\n\nThe ending saddened die-hard fans who had faithfully followed the adventures of the Los Angeles, California-based everyman-turned-private investigator whose stories played out in an era from the Jim Crow 1940s to the politically charged 1960s.\n\nNow Mosley, who has found success writing everything from erotica to science fiction, has launched a new mystery series with the release of his book "The Long Fall" (Riverhead).\n\nThe book features an ex-boxer named Leonid Trotter McGill, the latest colorfully named Mosley character. Three of his previous books involved ex-convict Socrates Fortlow, and another trio concerned bookseller Paris Minton.\n\nBut the new novel takes Mosley to a different place and time. Instead of mid-20th century Los Angeles, "The Long Fall" is set in modern-day New York, where McGill is finding it hard to leave his less-than-stellar past behind.\n\nThat past includes a childhood as a red-diaper baby abandoned by his union organizer father and left to fend for himself at an early age, a loveless marriage to an unfaithful woman named Katrina and a son who\'s a burgeoning criminal mastermind.\n\nMoreover, he\'s at work on a case where you just know people are going to die.\n\nSuch page turners are nothing new for Mosley, who is known for his strong, black male characters and his passionate musings on race, politics and the writing life.\n\nMcGill\'s creator recently spoke with CNN about the new mystery novel, why he doesn\'t miss Easy, and how the changes in the United States are mirrored in his writing. The following is an edited version of the interview.\n\nCNN: Why leave Los Angeles for a setting in modern-day New York?\n\nWalter Mosley: I have been a resident of both cities. The new series being contemporary and about a character who in some murky ways reflects where America is right now, New York seemed the right place for that.\n\nCNN: How so? Where do you think America is right now?\n\nMosley: I think that America has made a decision, after about 20 years of going in one direction, to go in another direction: to leave rampant and amoral kind of deregulation and also rampant and immoral wars and say, "Maybe we should be doing the right thing instead of the wrong thing," or redefining what the right thing is, at any rate.\n\nThose kinds of decisions, there are only two places [the setting] can be, and that\'s either in Washington, D.C., which I feel is very limiting because it\'s a one-business town, or New York, where everything from economics to government is centered.\n\nSo I decided on New York.\n\nCNN: McGill is trying to leave behind his shady past. Do you feel like America is trying to do the same?\n\nMosley: Yes, I think that\'s exactly what\'s happening. I think America is trying to seek redemption after having done many things wrong in the eyes of the world in general.\n\nLeonid McGill is trying to seek redemption after a long criminal history. His history is somewhat forgivable, but still it\'s criminal.\n\nCNN: Did you approach this book differently than you did when you were writing the Easy Rawlins mysteries?\n\nMosley: Yes and no. All books are different, so each of the Easy Rawlins books I wrote I approached differently. [Leonid] is a new character and he has a unique life that I had to begin to learn. I knew Easy very well, but Leonid I had to learn who he was.\n\nCNN: In your new book, I love that McGill\'s wife\'s name is "Katrina" and she leaves lots of destruction in her wake.\n\nMosley: [chuckling] It\'s true, but the first story I wrote about Leonid [a story called "Karma" published in the anthology "Dangerous Women"] was before the hurricane and that was a long time ago. It\'s funny that it worked out like that.\n\nCNN: What do you like about McGill?\n\nMosley: This is the first time in my experiments in crime fiction that I\'ve written a hard-boiled detective character. This is going all the way back to the beginning of the genre in the \'30s, where you have a guy who gets thumped upside the head a lot and he\'s just as bad as the people he\'s after.\n\nIn the old style, you never knew what was going on inside the hard-boiled character\'s head, but in these stories I am actually discovering the underlying character of the hard-boiled detective, and for me that\'s been a great deal of fun.\n\nCNN: You\'ve written so many various genres. What is it about the genre of crime fiction that appeals to you?\n\nMosley: Originally I got into it because you can talk about worlds that people wouldn\'t read about ordinarily unless they had a particular interest in it. Everybody reads crime fiction and they read it to find out about different worlds.\n\nI like writing in different genres. There\'s all this stuff that I really enjoy doing because I think they all serve different purposes.\n\nAnd listen, I\'m known as a crime writer, people like it and I enjoy it.\n\nCNN: For your fans, a lot of them miss Easy Rawlins. Do you miss him at all?\n\nMosley: No, he\'s right there on the shelf. All I have to do is reach up and pull him down.\n\nI\'m finished with that.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Scotland\'s Susan Boyle gives new meaning to the term "overnight sensation." The "Britain\'s Got Talent" contestant was expected to be something of a joke when she first sauntered on stage, but she absolutely wowed the audience, the judges -- and then the world via the Internet -- with her stunning rendition of "I Dreamed a Dream."\n\n\n\nAlong with Simon Cowell and Piers Morgan, Amanda Holden is a judge on "Britain\'s Got Talent."\n\n\n\nBut like others who stumble upon sudden fame, she found the pressure and scrutiny to be overwhelming.\n\n\n\n"Talent" judge Amanda Holden and Dr. Drew Pinsky of VH1\'s "Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew" joined CNN\'s Larry King Tuesday night to discuss Boyle\'s hospitalization for stress and the toll the spotlight and media criticism might have taken on her mental health. They also discussed whether Boyle will develop the emotional stamina for a high-pressure singing career.\n\n\n\nThe following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\n\n\nLarry King: What do we know right now?\n\n\n\nAmanda Holden: Basically, we\'ve spoken to Susan\'s brother. He, in fact, spoke on [CBS\' "The Early Show"] this morning to say that his sister was very keen to come home as soon as she possibly could and that she was resting up in a clinic in London and that she was very much looking forward to coming out and seeing what was available to her when she felt better.\n\n\n\nKing: Is the show, Amanda, paying for the hospital bills and are they taking care of her?\n\n\n\nHolden: I have no idea if they\'re paying the hospital bills. I would imagine that they are. We\'re a very loyal show. We love Susan very much. In fact, all the contestants that appear on our show are extraordinarily well looked after.\n\n\n\nKing: Your fellow judge, Piers Morgan, has said that there was talk of taking her off the show because of all the pressures on her. Were you involved? Were there any discussions like that?\n\n\n\nHolden: I wasn\'t involved in any discussions like that. And I think Piers has a slightly closer relationship with her.  ... The only thing I\'m worried about with Susan Boyle is that she seems to have a crush on Piers Morgan. ...\n\n\n\nI think that Piers kind of reassured her during the final that she was doing well and that she mustn\'t pay any kind of attention to the press and all the other stuff that was going\n\n\n\nKing: Despite all the tumult, there\'s no disputing that Susan sang her heart out during the finale of the competition. I know the dance troupe [Diversity] was terrific. But, frankly, why didn\'t she win?\n\n\n\nHolden: Honestly, I can\'t criticize the decision because it was the British public that voted in the end. I have no real idea, to be honest. I wonder whether it could be that Diversity was utterly fantastic on the show that night. They decimated the show. They really, really were amazing. And I just wonder whether maybe younger people voted and were quicker on the texts than the kind of people that were voting for Susan.\n\n\n\nBut as I keep saying, if Susan is a loser, then surely she is the biggest and best loser that we have in the world. And coming second is no bad thing.  Watch Amanda Holden discuss Susan Boyle »\n\n\n\nKing: She came in, though, [as] a small-town amateur singer, [with] learning disabilities due to suffering oxygen deprivation at birth. Some say the program exploited her and her vulnerabilities. Do you agree?\n\n\n\nHolden: I couldn\'t disagree more. You know, she\'s a grown woman who applied to come on a talent show. She enjoyed every second of every moment that I met her or saw her behind the scenes. She was very excited. She was very proud to be taking part in the show.\n\n\n\nI think the downturn in press in our country [Britain], I think, maybe stressed her out a little bit. And I think she was just quite upset about all the exaggerated stories and the kind of falsehoods that were being written about her. I think that everybody gets upset about bad press when you\'re in this business. And she\'s somebody that\'s gone from anonymity to [an] absolute worldwide phenomenon.\n\n\n\nKing: Yes.\n\n\n\nHolden: So how is she expected to handle that? Nobody can handle that with the best will in the world. I\'ve been in the business 15 years, and I\'m still not media savvy.\n\n\n\n[Dr. Drew Pinsky joins the show]\n\n\n\nKing: What do you make of this Susan Boyle thing?\n\n\n\nPinsky: The problem here is that here\'s a woman that\'s suddenly under the scrutiny of the spotlight who maybe has some  developmental issues, who is under tremendous stress and [now] is in a psychiatric hospital. The question is, did the show harm her?\n\n\n\nKing: Did it?\n\n\n\nPinsky: It\'s hard to say. This is the first time these kind of experiences have really been undertaken by people. People that come out of nowhere all of a sudden are international superstars.\n\n\n\nKing: Should we be, Amanda, concerned about that?\n\n\n\nHolden: First of all, I just want to say that Susan\'s brother said on British television this morning that, yes, Susan has experienced learning difficulties. But in actual fact, when she was at school, she did as well as any of her other siblings. But throughout her childhood, always before an exam or anything else, she always got quite anxious.\n\n\n\n[Before the show], she was feeling nervous. But she went out there and she nailed it. You know, she did the best performance that we\'ve seen. And let\'s not forget, this is actually only the second or third time we\'ve heard her sing. ...\n\n\n\nShe is in a place where celebrities go when they are burnt out. Now, I am obviously not a doctor. I have no factual information to give to you.

{'text': '(CNN) -- It\'s all tied up in Texas.\n\n\n\nSens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are running a tight race in Texas.\n\n\n\nA new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll suggests the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination between Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois is a statistical dead heat in Texas, which holds primaries March 4.\n\n\n\nIn the survey, out Monday, 50 percent of likely Democratic primary voters support Clinton as their choice for the party\'s nominee, with 48 percent backing Obama.\n\n\n\nBut taking into account the poll\'s sampling error of plus or minus 4½ percentage points for Democratic respondents, the race is a virtual tie.  Watch Democrats target Texas. »\n\n\n\nTwo recent polls by other organizations also show the race statistically even. Map: National and state polling\n\n\n\n"One reason the race appears to be tight is that Texas Democrats are having a hard time choosing between two attractive options," says CNN polling director Keating Holland.\n\n\n\n"Likely Democratic primary voters would be equally happy if either candidate won the nomination, and they don\'t see a lot of difference between them on several top issues.\n\n\n\n"Roughly a quarter of likely voters say they could change their minds in the next two weeks -- and not surprisingly, those people are splitting roughly equally between Clinton and Obama."\n\n\n\nMany political strategists and analysts consider Texas and Ohio -- which also holds a March 4 primary -- must-win states for Clinton. Obama has won the past eight contests and is now ahead in the overall battle for delegates, 193 of which are at stake in Texas.\n\n\n\nThe new survey indicates Arizona Sen. John McCain is the clear favorite for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\n\n\nAmong Republicans, 55 percent of likely Texas GOP primary voters support McCain as their choice for nominee. Thirty-two percent back former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and 11 percent support home-state congressman and former Libertarian standard-bearer Ron Paul. The poll\'s sampling error for Republican respondents is 4 percentage points.\n\n\n\nThe CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted by telephone from Friday through Sunday. Pollsters talked to 1,506 adults in Texas, including 553 likely Republican primary voters and 529 likely Democratic primary voters.\n\n\n\nMcCain is the overwhelming front-runner in the fight for the Republican presidential nomination and party leaders have rallied around the candidate in an attempt for party unity.\n\n\n\nThe poll was released on the same day the only living former Republican president -- George Herbert Walker Bush, the current president\'s father -- endorsed McCain at an event in Houston.  Watch McCain get a big boost »\n\n\n\nBut McCain has had trouble winning conservative voters. Just last week, McCain lost the conservative vote to Huckabee in the Virginia primary, according to exit polls. The new survey, though, suggests McCain may have better luck in Texas.\n\n\n\n"It looks like McCain has made some inroads with conservative Republicans," Holland said.\n\n\n\n"McCain is picking up a bare majority among conservative likely voters in the GOP primary. The McCain campaign probably wishes that number were higher, but it does mean that a McCain victory in Texas would not be based on the votes of moderates and independents, as has happened in several states in the past few weeks."\n\n\n\nTexas Democrats and Republicans may not see eye to eye on the issues, but the poll suggests they do agree on what\'s the most important issue. Thirty-five percent of Democrats and an equal number of Republicans said the economy was the most important issue in their choice for president.\n\n\n\nThe second most important issue for Democrats was health care, at 23 percent, followed by the war in Iraq at 22 percent, illegal immigration at 10 percent and terrorism at 7 percent.\n\n\n\nNineteen percent of Republicans said illegal immigration was their most important issue, putting it in second place, followed by the war in Iraq and terrorism at 17 percent and health care at 8 percent.\n\n\n\nSixty percent of Republicans say they\'ll definitely support the candidate they are now backing. That number climbs to 76 percent for Democrats.\n\n\n\nLikely Democratic primary voters view Clinton and Obama on roughly equal terms. Seventy-nine percent say they would be satisfied if Clinton were the nominee; an equal number feel the same way about Obama. Seventy-nine percent say it\'s likely Clinton can win the nomination; 82 percent say the same about Obama.\n\n\n\nThe two candidates are essentially tied on immigration, Iraq and the economy, but Clinton has an advantage on health care and abortion.

{'text': 'ATHENS, Georgia (CNN)  -- A University of Georgia professor apparently shot and killed his wife and two other people at a community theater group\'s reunion Saturday, then dropped the couple\'s two children off at a neighbor\'s and fled.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alert on the UGA Web site says professor George Zinkhan  is a suspect in an off-campus shooting.\n\n\n\n\n\nAthens-Clarke County police said they have local, regional and national alerts out for George Zinkhan, 57, an endowed marketing professor at the school\'s Terry College of Business.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It appeared he and his wife were having problems," police Capt. Clarence Holeman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHoleman identified the dead as Marie Bruce, 47, Zinkhan\'s wife and a prominent Athens attorney; Tom Tanner, 40; and Ben Teague, 63.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriends identified Bruce as the president of the board of the Town and Gown Players, the theater group holding a reunion picnic on the theater\'s deck when the shooting took place. Tanner and Teague were identified as set designers for the theater.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo other people were wounded by ricocheting bullets, Holeman said, but did not identify them. At least 20 people were in attendance at the event, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nZinkhan was not at the theater event initially, Holeman said, but when he arrived, he got into "a disagreement" with his wife. He left the scene -- police believe to his car, where his children were waiting -- and returned with two handguns.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It only took a few minutes," Holeman said. Police found eight shell casings, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the shootings, Zinkhan left the scene with his two children -- ages 8 and 10 -- still in the vehicle, police said. He drove to a neighbor\'s home in nearby Bogart, Georgia, where he lived, and left the children there.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe neighbor, Bob Covington, told CNN that Zinkhan arrived at his home shortly after noon with the two children.\n\n\n\n\n\n"He rang the doorbell -- asked me if I could keep his kids for about an hour," Covington said. "I said sure, and he said there\'d been some type of emergency, and he took off."\n\n\n\n\n\nZinkhan seemed hurried and agitated but that seemed consistent with an emergency, Covington said. He didn\'t question Zinkhan about the emergency, Covington said, adding that it wasn\'t unusual for someone in his family to watch the children.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn hour or so later, he said, police arrived and took the children.\n\n\n\n\n\nCovington described Zinkhan as "a very quiet guy, but family-oriented."\n\n\n\n\n\n"He was great around his kids," he said. "Never saw a bit of a problem between he his wife or his kids."\n\n\n\n\n\nCovington said he was "completely shocked, didn\'t believe it" when he heard the news, and said he knew Marie Bruce much better than her husband.\n\n\n\n\n\n"She was much more talkative, very vivacious," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice Maj. Mike Shockley told CNN that officers were searching Zinkhan\'s home Saturday and that a wide search for the suspect was in progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It\'s still a hunt," he said. " ...

Elliott-Gower said he didn\'t know Zinkhan well, but knew him through Zinkhan\'s wife who, like Elliott-Gower, was associated with the theater.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There are generations of people in the Athens community that have been involved in the theater," he said.

Check back for updates on his trip.\n\n\n\nCNN.com's Jarrett Bellini tours vineyards outside Cape Town, South Africa.\n\n\n\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa (CNN) -- I'm not a wine drinker.\n\n\n\nBefore today's excursion, in fact, I could only tell you that on the face of the planet there existed three types of wine: red, white and Carlo Rossi.  The reds are good with meat.  The whites go with fish.  And, according to what I learned from my dad, Carlo Rossi goes with a glass of ice.\n\n\n\nSo, exploring South Africa's wine country, just a short drive from Cape Town, seemed like a perfect educational way for me to spend my day.  I mean, it was that or go to a museum.\n\n\n\nOur guide, Jack, was amazingly knowledgeable about the subject, but without being a pretentious jerk.  Really, as far as he is concerned, the best wine in the world is whatever wine you enjoy.  I didn't ask, but was curious if that applied to Boone's Farm?\n\n\n\nThroughout the day, we hit four wineries, tasting 23 bottles in all.  I know because I kept hash marks on my hand.  I'm pretty classy.\n\n\n\nNow, despite the outstanding info we received from our guide as we sipped and swirled and spat, I can't say that I'm any better at understanding the finer points of wine than I was this morning when I woke up.  However, I did manage to get a solid buzz.  And that should be worth something.\n\n\n\nEven without the wine, a visit to South Africa's vineyards is a great addition to a traveler's to-do list. It's not far from the city and the scenery is beautiful. If you need an added incentive, there are even a few cheese farms in the area where you can really crank the whole experience up to 11.\n\n\n\nI personally thanked one of the goats for his contribution. He didn't seem to care. He also didn't seem physically capable of producing anything that might actually turn into cheese. But I thanked him anyway.\n\n\n\nWhat can I say?

{'text': '(CNN) -- When 3-year-old Rowan Isaacson darted away from his father and dived into a herd of grazing horses, it easily could have been the end of the small autistic boy. He was babbling under the hooves of a boss mare.\n\n\n\n\n\nRupert Isaacson says he noticed immediate improvement in his son\'s language skills when he started riding.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I thought he was going to get trampled," recalled Rupert Isaacson, Rowan\'s father.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the horse, Betsy, dipped her head and chewed with her mouth in submission. Isaacson, who had trained horses for a living, had never seen it happen so spontaneously. Rowan had seemingly made a connection.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Austin, Texas, family had been struggling with Rowan.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis wild tantrums were nearly driving Isaacson and his wife, Kristin Neff, to divorce. All the while, little Rowan was becoming unreachable.\n\n\n\n\n\n"He would just stare off into space," Isaacson said. "I was worried it was going to get progressively worse and that eventually, he might float away from us entirely. Luckily, right about that time is when he met Betsy."\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaacson began riding Betsy, a neighbor\'s horse, with Rowan. He says he noticed immediate improvement in his son\'s language skills.  Watch Rowan and Betsy »\n\n\n\n\n\n"He would start to answer. He would start to talk. We would do song games up there on the saddle. I would take books up there in the saddle," Isaacson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAutism specialists say that horse riding can be effective in gaining access to autistic children.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts make a distinction between the kind of recreational therapeutic riding Isaacson was using with Rowan and hippotherapy, which is a medical treatment that uses horses and is supervised by a licensed speech-language pathologist.\n\n\n\n\n\n"People perceive it\'s the interaction with the horse that\'s making the change. However, the movement of the horse is extremely powerful, and it\'s that movement that\'s having neurological impact on the autistic child," said Ruth Dismuke-Blakely, a speech-language pathologist and hippotherapy clinical specialist in Edgewood, New Mexico.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to preliminary analysis of an ongoing study by Dismuke-Blakely, hippotherapy has been shown to increase verbal communication skills in some autistic children in as little as 18 to 25 minutes of riding once a week for eight weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We see their arousal and affect change. They become more responsive to cues. If they are at a point where they are using verbal cues, you get more words," Dismuke-Blakely said. "It\'s almost like it opens them up. It gives us access."\n\n\n\n\n\nShe cautions that a horse\'s movements can be powerful. For some autistic children, riding too long can overstimulate their nervous system, leading to more erratic behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Betsy, Rowan was at ease. After about three weeks, Isaacson says, Rowan\'s improved behavior was translating into the home and outside world as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut not consistently.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn late 2004, Isaacson, a human rights activist, brought a delegation of African bushmen from Botswana to the United Nations. Among the men were traditional healers, who offered to work with Rowan.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaacson says he was skeptical, but he had experience with the bushmen and allowed the healers to lay their hands on his son.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I was kind of flabbergasted at Rowan\'s response. For about four days while they were with him, he started to lose some of his symptoms. He started to point, which was a milestone he hadn\'t achieved," Isaacson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the tribal healers left, Rowan regressed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaacson says he couldn\'t help but wonder what would happen if he were to give Rowan a longer exposure to the two things that he seemed to have responded well to: horses and shamans.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I know it sounds completely crazy," he said. "I just had a gut feeling."\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaacson took his wife and son to Mongolia.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It\'s the oldest horse culture on the planet. Everyone still gets around on a horse there -- so a nomadic culture. The word \'shaman\' comes from there," Isaacson said, explaining his decision. "I just thought, \'Well, what if we went there and rode across the steppe and visited traditional healers? You know, what might happen for Rowan? Might there be some positive outcomes?\' "\n\n\n\n\n\nTrekking across the Mongolian prairie on horseback, Isaacson says, Rowan\'s behavior was changed dramatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Rowan was not cured of autism out there," Isaacson stressed. "The word \'cure\' is not in my vocabulary for this. Rowan came back without three key dysfunctions that he had. He went out to Mongolia incontinent and still suffering from these neurological firestorms -- so tantruming all the time and cut off from his peers, unable to make friends -- and he came back with those three dysfunctions having gone."\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaacson credits Rowan\'s improvement to horses and time in nature -- and to shamanic healing, which he says he simply can\'t explain rationally.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaacson has written a book, "The Horse Boy," about Rowan\'s autism.\n\n\n\n\n\nRowan, now 7, rides Betsy by himself. His parents never abandoned more orthodox treatments for his autism, and Rowan\'s applied behavioral analysis therapist has him studying math and English at the third-grade level -- a full year ahead of some of his peers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"He\'s just becoming a very functional autistic person," Isaacson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as the Isaacson family\'s journey took them, it is the same hard slog facing millions of families gripped by autism.\n\n\n\n\n\n"A lot of the parents go to the ends of the Earth in their own living rooms every day," Isaacson said. "I mean, we had more stressful car rides to the grocery store than any of the stresses and challenges of the trip to Mongolia."\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don\'t have to get on a horse -- or plane to Siberia -- for relief. For autism families, Isaacson encourages parents to simply follow their instincts and listen to what their child shows them.\n\n\n\n\n\n"In our case, it was horses in Mongolia and these shamans," Isaacson said. "It could just as easily have been bicycles and, you know, steam trains. And if it had been, we\'d have done a steam train journey. We\'d have done whatever Rowan seemed to be showing us he wanted to do, because that was where he was intrinsically motivated."', 'qa': [{'question': 'What disorder does Rowan Isaacson have?', 'answers': ['autistic']}, {'question': 'Where did the family travel?', 'answers': ['Mongolia.']}, {'question': 'What do experts say about riding horses?', 'answers': ['is extremely powerful, and it\'s that movement that\'s having neurological impact on the autistic child,"', 'autistic child,"', 'make a distinction between the kind of recreational therapeutic', "it's the interaction with the", 'neurological impact on', 'can be effective in gaining access to autistic children.', "that's making the change.

He spoke to CNN\'s Larry King about the decision and President Obama\'s health care plans. Here is an edited transcript:\n\n\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta says he just returned from India, where he looked into medical tourism.\n\n\n\nLarry King: But, first, breaking news about CNN\'s own Dr. Sanjay Gupta, long rumored to be the main candidate for U.S. surgeon general. He\'s taken himself out of the running. Joins us now here in Los Angeles to talk about it. Why?\n\n\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta: Well, first of all, it was a really tough decision, and a long decision and a long process for sure. And I was incredibly flattered, humbled by the consideration even for the position.\n\n\n\nI think for me it really came down to a sense of timing more than anything else. You know, I have two daughters. Our third daughter is now imminent. In fact, I have my phone on right here, I might get called off the set.\n\n\n\nKing: As we talk.\n\n\n\nGupta: As we talk, my wife is imminent with our third child. You know, this job that we have collectively takes us away from our children for so many years at once, and I sort of came to grips with the fact that I\'d probably be away at least the first several years, four or five years -- there\'s my existing two daughters, one more on the way -- but several years of their lives. And I just didn\'t feel like I should do that now.\n\n\n\nAnd the other thing, let me just add, you know, you know me and a lot of people know me, obviously, as a journalist for CNN, but you know, I continue to practice neurosurgery, Larry. You and I have talked about that, and I...\n\n\n\nKing: You do brain surgery all the time.\n\n\n\nGupta: Yes. And it\'s an important part of my life. And I work at a county hospital. That\'s the hospital I\'ve chosen to work at in Atlanta [Georgia]. And I really enjoy that.\n\n\n\nI came to grips with, ironically, that being surgeon general, I probably would not be able to continue to practice surgery.\n\n\n\nKing: How about the cut in pay?\n\n\n\nGupta: Well, you know, that\'s a sacrifice we were willing to make.\n\n\n\nI think, you know, either you\'re a public servant or you\'re not a public servant. I\'ve always been drawn to public service. So that really wasn\'t a consideration for me.\n\n\n\nKing: Was it an offer or a "would you consider if"?\n\n\n\nGupta: It\'s a little bit of a funny thing -- and I\'ve never been through this process before. I guess the formal part of it is when you are nominated. I was not nominated, but I had conversations with the senior-most people that would make an offer, and they told me they wanted me to do this job. So...\n\n\n\nKing: Was it the thought of [Democratic former] Sen. Tom Daschle, who was going to be secretary of health, that you be his surgeon general?\n\n\n\nGupta: Well, I did have conversations with him, but you know, the fact that he withdrew did not play as big a role in my mind in terms of not considering the job. Again, I think either you do public service or you don\'t. You want your job to be as precisely defined as possible, for sure, but that wasn\'t a major factor.\n\n\n\nKing: The way it was presented, then, you feel that you would have been offered it even if Daschle had not left or had left, no matter what?\n\n\n\nGupta: I think so. You know, I mean, you know, I\'ve had a lot of conversations with the White House folks. I think there was a big interest on their part, and obviously they know of my dedication to public service. I think there was a real melding there.\n\n\n\nKing: Do you have anyone you would recommend for that job?\n\n\n\nGupta: You know, no one off the top of my head. I mean, I think whoever takes that job really does have to make it a higher-profile job. I mean, this is an important job. I have a great deal of respect for the office and for the commissioned corps. You\'ve seen the work they do. They do life-saving...\n\n\n\nKing: A lot of clout.\n\n\n\nGupta: Yes, a lot of clout, life-saving, life-preventing work -- or life-preserving work -- all over the country every single day. And I think that it has to have a little bit of a higher profile. Whoever takes this job has to be out there really advocating the issues of public health. At no time is it probably more important than right now, as we\'re dealing with health care reform. These issues really go hand in hand.\n\n\n\nKing: Well, their loss is a continuing our gain.\n\n\n\nGupta: I appreciate that.\n\n\n\nKing: If I may speak to it.\n\n\n\nGupta: I would miss this witty banter for sure, back and forth.\n\n\n\nKing: May I speak for CNN. But you had to be flattered.\n\n\n\nGupta: I was flattered. And you know, I have a great deal of respect for that office. And I in no way want people to think that I don\'t. This is really more about my family and my surgical career.\n\n\n\nKing: Couple other notes. I know you\'re just back from India. I want to ask about that.\n\n\n\nGupta: Yes.\n\n\n\nKing: President Obama held a health care summit [Thursday] at the White House. More than 100 experts, policy makers took part, including some who opposed the Clinton administration\'s health care reform back in the \'90s. Do you support his aims?\n\n\n\nGupta: He is drawing an inextricable relationship between the economy and health care. As people talk -- the economy is issue No. 1, as we talk about all the time. But he\'s making the point, I think, and he has been for some time, even while he was campaigning, that you cannot talk about the economy without talking about health care.\n\n\n\nThe businesses have to provide health care insurance for their employees. It is often very difficult for them to do that, in addition to trying to reach some sort of profit from their product. So I -- that message, I think, has been pretty loud and clear, and I think it is resonating.\n\n\n\nHe\'s also talking about the fact that you can\'t fix the health care system without bringing down costs of health care overall. And since you brought it up, I was just in India, and one of the stories that I was doing was about medical tourism. Here is a good example -- 750,000 Americans leave the United States every year to go abroad for life-saving operations. Why? Mainly because of cost. It can be up to a tenth of the cost in some of these countries such as India, such as Singapore.\n\n\n\nKing: Open-heart surgery in India might be one-tenth of what it costs here?\n\n\n\nGupta: One-tenth. Hip surgery, neurosurgery. All -- a lot of these various operations. And the real question, and I think it\'s a question worth exploring, is why? How can they do it so much cheaper?\n\n\n\nHow can they offer good-quality care? I saw it. It is good-quality care. I saw that with my own eyes. What do we have to learn? And how can we use this to help reform our health care system?\n\n\n\nKing: Is there an assumption that we have the best doctors, that we do it better than anybody else, that\'s an American assumption?\n\n\n\nGupta: Yes. And I think, you know, we do provide very good health care for people who have access to it.\n\n\n\nKing: Ah.\n\n\n\nGupta: And I think that\'s part of the problem.\n\n\n\nKing: That\'s the rub, though, right?\n\n\n\nGupta: That is the rub. And I think there are really two schools of thought, which we are going to hopefully distill down, as we talk about this issue more and more. One is, do you revamp the entire health care system? Do you say, look, this health care system is broken, toss it all out, let\'s start all over again? Or do you say, look, it works pretty well for a fraction of the population. Let\'s see who it doesn\'t work for and fix those things only. So don\'t throw the baby out with the bath water. Let\'s target what\'s broken and focus on that.\n\n\n\nKing: What role in all of this will the new surgeon general play?\n\n\n\nGupta: I really don\'t know. I\'m not sure. At one point...\n\n\n\nKing: He would have to be a proponent for it, you would think.\n\n\n\nGupta: You know, the surgeon general has an interesting position, and this is something that I learned. It is truly one of the more apolitical positions at that senior level. So they are really the nation\'s doctor. I think that they really have to focus on making sure that best health practices are constantly known. It\'s amazing how high the health illiteracy rate remains in this country. To remind people how to best take care of themselves.\n\n\n\nKing: One other thing. Do you think it\'s going to -- do you think we\'re going to get a new health care program?\n\n\n\nGupta: I think so. It\'s going to take a long time. I think that it may not even happen within this first term, if there is a second term for him. So I think it\'s not going to be something that happens certainly overnight. The fact that they had a health care summit this early on I think is probably a good sign of at least his commitment to this issue.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What challenges are discussed?', 'answers': ['timing']}, {'question': 'What would the job have taken him from?', 'answers': ['our children', 'takes us away', 'children', 'himself out of the running.', "He's"]}, {'question': 'What was the disadvantage of the job?', 'answers': ['takes us away from our children', 'takes us away from our children for so many years at once,']}, {'question': 'What did it come down to?', 'answers': ['sense of timing']}, {'question': 'What would have taken him away too long from family?', 'answers': ['U.S. surgeon general.', 'surgeon general of the United States']}, {'question': 'Who faces challenges in reforming health care?', 'answers': ['Gupta:', "President Obama's"]}, {'question': 'What challenges does Obama face?', 'answers': ['things', 'daughters.']}]}

{'text': 'WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- William Jackson was a slave in the home of Confederate president Jefferson Davis during the Civil War. It turns out he was also a spy for the Union Army, providing key secrets to the North about the Confederacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam Jackson, a slave, listened closely to Jefferson Davis\' conversations and leaked them to the North.\n\n\n\n\n\nJackson was Davis\' house servant and personal coachman. He learned high-level details about Confederate battle plans and movements because Davis saw him as a "piece of furniture" -- not a human, according to Ken Dagler, author of "Black Dispatches," which explores espionage by America\'s slaves.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Because of his role as a menial servant, he simply was ignored," Dagler said.  "So Jefferson Davis would hold conversations with military and Confederate civilian officials in his presence."\n\n\n\n\n\nDagler has written extensively on the issue for the CIA\'s Center for the Study of Intelligence .  Watch the stories of slaves as spies »\n\n\n\n\n\nIn late 1861, Jackson fled across enemy lines and was immediately debriefed by Union soldiers. Dagler said Jackson provided information about supply routes and military strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n"In Jackson\'s case, what he did was ... present some of the current issues that were affecting the Confederacy that you could not read about in the local press that was being passed back and forth across local lines. He actually had some feel for the issues of supply problems," Dagler said.\n\n\n\n\n\nJackson and other slaves\' heroic efforts have been a forgotten legacy of the war -- lost amid the nation\'s racially charged past and the heaps of information about the war\'s historic battles. But historians over the last few decades have been taking an interest in the sacrifice of  African-Americans during those war years.\n\n\n\n\n\nJackson\'s espionage is mentioned in a letter from a general to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell refers to "Jeff Davis\' coachman" as the source of information about Confederate deployments.  Watch grandson of slaves: "They call me Little Man" »\n\n\n\n\n\nDagler said slaves who served as spies were able to collect incredibly detailed information, in large part because of their tradition of oral history. Because Southern laws prevented blacks from learning how to read and write, he said, the slave spies listened intently to minute details and memorized them.\n\n\n\n\n\n"What the Union officers found very quickly with those who crossed the line ... was that if you talked to them, they remembered a great more in the way of details and specifics than the average person ... because again they relied totally on their memory as opposed to any written records," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nJackson wasn\'t the only spy. There were hundreds of them. In some cases, the slaves made it to the North, only to return to the South to risk being hanged. One Union general wrote that he counted on black spies in Tennessee because "no white man had the pluck to do it."\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one was better than Robert Smalls, a slave who guided vital supply ships in and out of Charleston Harbor in South Carolina. He eventually escaped and provided the Union with "a turning of the forces in Charleston Harbor," according to an annual report of the Navy secretary to President Lincoln.\n\n\n\n\n\n"A debriefing of him gave ... the Union force there the entire fortification scheme for the interior harbor," Dagler said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most iconic spies was Harriet Tubman, who ran the Underground Railroad, bringing slaves to the North. In 1863, she was asked by the Union to help with espionage in South Carolina. She picked former slaves from the region for an espionage ring and led many of the spy expeditions herself.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The height of her intelligence involvement occurred late in 1863 when she actually led a raid into South Carolina," Dagler said. "In addition to the destruction of millions of dollars of property, she brought out over 800 slaves back into freedom in the North."\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the nation marks Black History Month in February, Dagler said that history should include the sacrifices of the African-Americans who risked their lives for their nation. Many paid the ultimate sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\n\n"They were all over the place, and no one [in the South] considered them to be of any value. Consequently, they heard and saw virtually everything done by their masters, who were the decision-makers," Dagler said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatever happened to William Jackson, the spy in Jefferson Davis\'s house?\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, that remains a great unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n"He simply disappeared from history, as so many of them have."\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Wayne Drash contributed to this report.', 'qa': [{'question': 'who learned key details inside the home of Jefferson Davis?', 'answers': ['William Jackson,', 'Jackson', 'William Jackson']}, {'question': "What is William Jackson's relevance?", 'answers': ['was a slave in the home of Confederate president Jefferson Davis', 'slave,', 'during the Civil War.']}, {'question': 'Where did he live during that time?', 'answers': ['home of Confederate president Jefferson Davis', 'in the home of Confederate president Jefferson Davis', 'the home of Confederate president Jefferson Davis']}, {'question': 'wher Author said history must never forget the sacrifice of African-Americans?', 'answers': ['Ken Dagler,', 'Dagler']}, {'question': 'What did Jackson learn of?', 'answers': ['high-level details about Confederate battle plans and movements']}, {'question': 'where Davis was president of the Confederacy?', 'answers': ['the North.']}, {'question': 'What did the author say about the war?', 'answers': ['slaves who served as spies were able to collect incredibly detailed information,']}, {'question': 'Who was the President of the Confederacy?', 'answers': ['Jefferson Davis']}]}

{'text': 'WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The beautifully ornate Catholic church in the nation\'s capital has seen its share of history and controversy.\n\n\n\nCardinal Theodore McCarrick and Chief Justice John Roberts attend Red Mass in 2005.\n\n\n\nIn 1963, the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle was the site of John F. Kennedy\'s funeral. After the service, on the steps outside, the slain president\'s young son famously saluted his father\'s memory.\n\n\n\nBut the church is also the site of an annual Mass that has drawn criticism for what many see as an unhealthy mix of politics, the law and religion.\n\n\n\nWashington\'s annual Red Mass, which celebrates the legal profession, will be held this year on Sunday, October 4 -- the day before the Supreme Court begins its new term. Several justices traditionally attend, along with congressional leaders, diplomats, cabinet secretaries and other dignitaries.\n\n\n\nPast presidents have also attended, though there is no word yet on whether President Obama will appear.\n\n\n\nIt is a Catholic service, but power brokers of other faiths are asked to attend the invitation-only event. Justice Stephen Breyer, who is Jewish, is a regular.\n\n\n\nThe Mass "takes its name from the color of the vestments. ... [It] goes back centuries, to Rome, to France to England," Washington Archbishop Donald Wuerl said.\n\n\n\n"There was the idea [to] bring all the people who are involved in the law ... once a year so that together, they can simply pray for the wisdom of God."\n\n\n\nThe church, built starting in the 19th century, is considered one of Washington\'s hidden gems. Tucked between modern office buildings a few blocks from the White House, it is a mix of architectural styles, a hint of ancient Roman style, a splash from the Italian Renaissance and a definite Byzantine flavor.\n\n\n\nSt. Matthew, noted Monsignor Ronald Jameson, was the patron saint of civil servants, appropriate in a city where the federal government dominates the workforce.\n\n\n\nFive justices attended last year\'s Red Mass, which was similar in tone to other recent gatherings. Cardinal John Patrick Foley, who has held several prominent positions in the Catholic Church, noted many parts of the Bible "sound very much like American ideals" and reminded the members of the high court to build a society "of justice, of peace and of love."\n\n\n\nCritics of the service, however, find the attendance of leading decision-makers, including members of the highest court in the land, to be inappropriate.\n\n\n\n"The truth is, this was set up as a way to basically lecture and give information to the justices," said the Rev. Barry Lynn, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. "There is no other institution that has this special way to talk to the justices on the Supreme Court."\n\n\n\nThe Red Mass was started in Washington in 1952 by the John Carroll Society, a lay Catholic group of prominent lawyers and professionals. Chief Justice John Roberts\' wife, Jane, is an officer of the group.\n\n\n\nLynn, an ordained minister with the United Church of Christ, noted the Mass was begun after several high court decisions that were disapproved of by the archdiocese.\n\n\n\n"They figured if they got all the justices together and chatted them up in a worship service, they might be able to convince them to see the law their way," he said.\n\n\n\nIn 1989, a top church official used the occasion of the Mass to call for a return to "religiously based moral values" and lament the "inviolable, impenetrable and towering wall" between church and state.\n\n\n\nIn 1986, Washington Cardinal James Hickey attacked the Supreme Court\'s Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion.\n\n\n\nAmong those in attendance that year were then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and William Brennan, both Catholics.\n\n\n\nOne member of the court who no longer attends is Ruth Bader Ginsburg who, like Breyer, is Jewish. Ginsberg said she grew tired of being lectured to by Catholic officials.\n\n\n\n"I went one year, and I will never go again, because this sermon was outrageously anti-abortion," Ginsburg said in the book "Stars of David: Prominent Jews talk About Being Jewish" by author Abigail Pogrebin.\n\n\n\n"Even the Scalias, although they\'re much of that persuasion, were embarrassed for me."\n\n\n\nSix Catholics now sit on the high court: Roberts, Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor.\n\n\n\nChurch officials, however, said they do not attempt to lobby or seek to persuade anyone who attends the service. Wuerl likens the experience to putting aside the partisanship and troubles in the world and seeking comfort in a shared community and a sacred place.\n\n\n\nAmericans have "been very careful about ... not allowing any one tradition or church to become the state church," he said. "But from the very beginning, we\'ve always said we need to hear the voice of faith in all the discussion that is a part of determining what we want to do."\n\n\n\nLynn takes a different tack.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t think there is any doubt that people in that congregation, including the Supreme Court justices, are going to listen to what is said. They might hear something phrased in a way you might never hear it in the court, but it might become a lingering factor in their decisions. ... People who are concerned about the Red Mass worry about this kind of undue influence, an influence that no other group, religious or otherwise, has on those nine men and women."\n\n\n\nTheir sharply differing perspectives show that, more than two centuries after the Constitution\'s ratification, the interpretation of the First Amendment and the role of religion in American society remain hotly contested questions.\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Elaine Quijano contributed to this report.', 'qa': [{'question': 'what several Supreme Court justices regularly attend?', 'answers': ['Roberts, Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito', 'Sonia Sotomayor.', 'Red Mass,', 'Stephen Breyer,']}, {'question': 'What do critics say the Mass is set up to do?', 'answers': ['the justices,"', 'find the attendance of leading decision-makers, including members of the highest court in the land,', 'be inappropriate.', 'lecture and give information']}, {'question': 'what Annual Catholic Mass in Washington celebrates?', 'answers': ['Red', 'legal profession,']}, {'question': 'When did it begin?', 'answers': ['Sunday, October 4']}, {'question': 'What do critics say', 'answers': ['the attendance of leading decision-makers, including members of the highest court in the land, to be inappropriate.']}, {'question': 'When did the mass begin', 'answers': ['Washington in 1952', '1952']}, {'question': 'What does the Annual Catholic Mass in Washington celebrate?', 'answers': ['legal profession,', 'the legal profession,']}, {'question': 'What does the annual catholic mass celebrate', 'answers': ['legal profession,', 'the legal profession,']}, {'question': 'what It is touted as a chance for those involved in law?', 'answers': ['the wisdom of God."', 'pray', "Washington's annual Red Mass,"]}]}

{'text': '(CNN) -- Sri Lankan officials rejected a proposed cease-fire from the Tamil Tiger rebels Sunday, warning instead that government troops intended to continue a new offensive until the group surrenders, a senior government official said.\n\n\n\nTamil demonstrators call for a cease-fire in Sri Lanka during a rally Saturday in Paris, France.\n\n\n\n"The government is firm that (the rebels) lay down their arms and surrender. We do not recognize this so-called offer," said Lakshman Hulugalle, director of Sri Lanka\'s Media Center for National Security.\n\n\n\nThe proposed cease-fire came six days after the Sri Lankan army launched a new offensive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) in the country\'s northern area. Government troops made significant advances into rebel-held territory on Friday and Saturday, according to Sri Lankan Army sources.\n\n\n\nA government-imposed deadline for the Tigers to surrender passed last Tuesday. Tens of thousands of displaced civilians currently remain wedged in a dwindling swath of territory controlled by the Tigers along the country\'s northeastern coast.\n\n\n\nGovernment troops say they have rescued 39,000 civilians trapped in the area, but a U.N. refugee agency said Friday that a wave of "fresh displacement" has now exceeded 100,000 individuals.\n\n\n\n"In the face of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis and in response to the calls made by the U.N., EU, the governments of the USA, India and others, the (LTTE) has announced an unilateral cease-fire.

{'text': 'CARACAS, Venezuela (CNN)  -- The price of sin rose Monday in Venezuela where President Hugo Chavez is on a campaign to make Venezuelans cut back on drinking and smoking.\n\n"Everyone\'s shocked," said Leonora Marino, owner of Bodegon Marino in Valencia, Venezuela, west of Caracas.\n\nOn Monday evening, she was still changing the prices in her store as her customers looked on and complained, she told a reporter.\n\nAlcohol is now 10 percent more expensive; cigarettes are 20 percent pricier.\n\n"Really, it\'s difficult to buy at these prices," she said, then joked, "They say they\'re going to stop eating so that they can continue drinking."\n\nThe Venezuelan government is placing a higher tax on alcohol and cigarettes in an effort to cut consumption and prevent what it views as the social, economic and moral consequences of drinking and smoking, said Jose Vielma Mora, superintendent of Seniat, the government body that oversees the collection of taxes.\n\nTaxes on whiskey, brandy, cognac and other drinks that don\'t come from cane sugar have been raised $1.79 (3,838 bolivares) per liter, the government-run Bolivarian News Agency said.\n\n"It\'s unfair because, in the end, the consumer is the one who pays," said Fernando Fernandez, a liquor exporter.\n\nChavez has described whiskey as a drink for rich people, not for revolutionaries.\n\n"We cannot be spending the international reserves of this country on whiskey," he said.\n\nThe moves represent the first steps toward transforming each Venezuelan into what Chavez calls "the new man." Chavez has cited the life of revolutionary socialist icon Ernesto "Che" Guevara as an example of how to lead a more pure life.\n\nIn April, Chavez told a graduating class of medical students in Caracas, Venezuela, that the level of consumption of alcohol in the country represents a threat to public health and ought to make residents feel ashamed, according to an ABN report.\n\n"The vice causes much harm, not only to individuals, but to the collective health of the nation," said Chavez, who said the dangers result in an increase in car wrecks and domestic violence.\n\nFor his part, he has said he drinks too much coffee.\n\nAlso effective Monday, stores near schools, churches and cultural centers will not be granted licenses to sell alcohol.\n\nTaxes on cigarette imports have also increased, from 50 percent to 70 percent of the total price.\n\nOn the street, some people said they don\'t understand the motivations for the increase, but predicted their consumption would not change.\n\n"The Venezuelan is not going to stop drinking or smoking," said one person.\n\nChavez also plans to increase taxes on luxury items such as Hummers, which are imported privately and at great expense. There is no Hummer dealership in the country.\n\nHigher oil prices in recent years have translated into higher consumption in petroleum-rich Venezuela. Last year, car sales increased by about 70 percent, according to the CIA World Factbook.\n\nBut Chavez, who was in Cuba on Monday visiting communist leader Fidel Castro, said he wants to focus less on material goals for Venezuela\'s 27 million people, 38 percent of whom live in poverty.

To cut a finger off a victim and show it to people? This is a savage being"\n\n\n\n\n\nGibbs\' attorney, Phillip Stackhouse, had asked the court for a sentence of life with parole so Gibbs would have the opportunity to be with his now-3-year-old son again.\n\n\n\n\n\n"He has a long time to reflect on his life, what he has done and what he wants to do in the future," Stackhouse said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGibbs is the highest ranking of five soldiers charged with being part of a rogue "kill squad" that targeted civilians. Another seven soldiers also were charged with lesser crimes including abusing drugs, keeping "off the books" weapons and intimidating a fellow soldier not to speak out against the platoon\'s alleged killings.\n\n\n\n\n\nGibbs had pleaded not guilty.\n\n\n\n\n\nA prosecutor described Gibbs as a "recruiting poster" soldier. But the tall, clean-cut Gibbs and the "kill squad" he was convicted of leading turned into a public-relations nightmare for the military.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Sgt. Gibbs had a charisma, he had a \'follow me\' personality," Maj. Robert Stelle, a prosecutor in the case, told the court in closing arguments Wednesday. "But it was all a bunch of crap, he had his own mission: murder and depravity."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe murders Gibbs is accused of committing took place over a period of five months last year, while Gibbs led the 3rd Platoon of the ArmyÂ¹s 5th Stryker Brigade in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nGibbs\' platoon was tasked with patrolling small villages in the area to build relationships with an Afghan population wary of the U.S. presence in their country. Instead, prosecutors said Gibbs and a small group of rogue soldiers allegedly plotted to murder civilians and then planted weapons on them so they appeared to be Taliban attackers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Selling a fake engagement as a real engagement, that\'s what they were doing," Stelle told the court.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn court testimony, Gibbs said he did not execute anyone. Prosecutors said Gibbs participated in the killings of three unarmed civilians: two farmers and a village cleric.\n\n\n\n\n\nGibbs said he killed one of the men, but he claimed it was in self-defense. However, the staff sergeant admitted to ripping and cutting off fingers of all three men he was charged with killing. He kept the body parts, he said, to give to soldiers he favored or to intimidate soldiers he disliked.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I was numb to the situation," Gibbs told the court about why he had taken the body parts. "I wasn\'t thinking; it\'s sickening. I am embarrassed."\n\n\n\n\n\nGibbs also admitted to posing for photos with bodies against military regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"People wanted to prove they were there," Gibbs replied when asked by his attorney why the soldiers took the photos. The Army later apologized after the photos were leaked to the press.\n\n\n\n\n\nGibbs appeared shocked after the verdict was read, and his wife, Army Spec. Chelsy Gibbs, began to cry. According to court records, she filed for divorce from Staff Sgt. Gibbs in August and asked for custody of their toddler son.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe panel of three officers and two enlisted soldiers started deliberating in a military courtroom near Tacoma shortly before 10 a.m. (1 p.m. ET) and returned its verdict around 3 p.m. (6 p.m. ET).\n\n\n\n\n\nPhillip Stackhouse, Gibbs\' defense attorney, had argued other soldiers were framing his client. Three soldiers pleaded guilty to the killings and agreed to testify against Gibbs as part of plea deals.\n\n\n\n\n\n"What if there is no hard evidence other than what you have heard from that witness stand?" Stackhouse said Wednesday. Some witnesses also admitted to smoking hashish they obtained from Afghan translators. Their testimony, Stackhouse said, "came under a cloud of hash."\n\n\n\n\n\nStackhouse argued Gibbs wasn\'t where other witnesses said he was during the engagements. And, according to Stackhouse, in February 2010 Gibbs couldn\'t have smuggled an AK-47 in his backpack into a village where prosecutors said he then planted the assault rifle on the body of an Afghan man he had killed. Grasping an AK-47, Stackhouse showed the rifle would not fully fit into a soldier\'s backpack.\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutors countered that Gibbs had used a model of the rifle that has a shorter muzzle and could be concealed.\n\n\n\n\n\nGibbs remains under investigation for the 2004 shooting death of a family in Iraq during his tour there, Army spokesman Maj. Chris Ophardt told CNN Thursday. The investigation into the family\'s killing had been closed but was reopened after Gibbs was charged with the murders of civilians in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring testimony last week, Gibbs said he shot at a car that failed to stop at a checkpoint in Iraq that he was manning.\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the bullet-riddled car, Gibbs testified, were not combatants but an unarmed Iraqi family. Gibbs admitted in court that he told his troops in Afghanistan about the Iraq shooting as an example that soldiers would not face consequences for acting aggressively, even if civilians were hurt.\n\n\n\n\n\n"If they are put in a tight situation, don\'t not pull the trigger," Gibbs said he advised members of his platoon in Afghanistan.

{'text': 'Editor\'s note: Bryan Batt, who plays the closeted art director Salvatore Romano in the Emmy award-winning cable TV series "Mad Men," has acted in nine Broadway and nine Off-Broadway productions, such as "Sunset Boulevard," "Beauty and the Beast," "Jeffrey" and "Starlight Express." Batt, who is 45, has been acting for 23 years. He spoke to CNN.com about being an openly gay actor.\n\n\n\n"We have to work toward acceptance on all levels," says actor Bryan Batt, who is openly gay.\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- There was once a time when the revelation of one\'s homosexuality in Hollywood was thought to be a career-killer.\n\n\n\nNow, out gays and lesbians such as TV host Ellen DeGeneres and pop singer Clay Aiken are featured on the cover of People magazine. There are also more gay characters on prime-time television shows than ever before.\n\n\n\nBut even with greater acceptance by the mainstream public, is coming out still a big deal?\n\n\n\nTo shed light on the issue, CNN recently spoke to Bryan Batt, 45, about his experience as an openly gay actor in Hollywood.\n\n\n\nCNN: Has being openly gay affected your career?\n\n\n\nBatt: I came from the stage; much of my experience has been on the Broadway and Off-Broadway stage. Being gay never really posed a problem. In the Broadway community, it\'s always been a little more accepted. There\'s something different with film acting and TV acting. You\'re in someone\'s home -- it\'s more intimate.\n\n\n\nWhen I look at someone, I really don\'t care about whom they\'re sleeping with or what they\'re doing. I\'m thinking they either have talent or no talent. But people are really obsessed with wanting to know about the ins and outs of people\'s private lives. It\'s still like high school.  Batt plays both straight, gay roles »\n\n\n\nCNN: When did you come out?\n\n\n\nBatt: My real Broadway break was in "Starlight Express." At that time, I was toying with [coming out]. It\'s harder to live a lie than to try to hide your natural instincts and your natural longings just to conform to what other people think you should be. I\'ve heard of people doing it in Hollywood. It\'s a very sad and difficult choice. I think it\'s a personal journey, and I think people on their own time will figure it out. Clay Aiken is still really very, very young; he has to deal with his own issues.\n\n\n\nThank God, when it was my time, no one was pushing me; no one was trying to force me. It was on my own terms intimately with my mother and brother. It went wonderfully. My mother said, "No matter what, you\'re my son. I\'m going to love you."\n\n\n\nNot one of my family or friends turned their back on me. I was fortunate, but it was still a very difficult thing to do, and I was fearful. Afterwards, it was like the heaviest weight was taken off my back; all those years worrying for nothing. But not everyone is as lucky; some people are shunned and kicked out of their homes and families, which is criminal.\n\n\n\nJust this year, I was asked to host a fundraiser for The Point Foundation, a wonderful group that provides full college scholarships to gay and lesbian students of merit who have suffered such treatment by their families and cannot afford tuition and the necessary funds for higher education -- an inspiring organization.\n\n\n\nI only told my mother and my brother after I was cast in "Jeffrey," a play by Paul Rudnick that was the first AIDS comedy. I said to myself, if I get this, I\'ve just got to sit down and talk with my family.\n\n\n\nMy partner and I have been together 19 years, and that was the same time he told his parents. A good parent knows; they love and accept. What most good parents want for their children is for their child to be happy and healthy and be good contributing members of society.\n\n\n\nCNN: Are there barriers to what openly gay actors can do today?\n\n\n\nBatt: It\'s just like any prejudice, once you let go of any prejudice they all have to go. They\'re not based on facts, just on stereotypes. I really think yes, there might be some homophobia in Hollywood, but it\'s based on what will sell. Hollywood is a huge industry, a multibillion-dollar business. If actors who are gay will get ratings and will sell, they will get cast.\n\n\n\nThere are always going to be people who look at people who are different and who disapprove [of them] either through fear or through ignorance. We have to work toward acceptance on all levels. How long ago were the civil rights movement and the women\'s movement? And, still today, women don\'t make the same amount of money as men do for doing the same job.\n\n\n\nCNN: What\'s your view of the character you play, Salvatore Romano, in "Mad Men"?\n\n\n\nBatt: The character basically is clearly gay to a 2007 audience, but no one in the world of 1960 is suspicious whatsoever. What a great role to play. This season, I\'m married. I get stopped all the time on the street, and I get asked, "When is your character coming out?" What is he coming out to in 1962?\n\n\n\nI asked to get married this season. I thanked [series creator] Matthew Weiner, and he said, "You asked." It provides another wonderful level to the character. That is what happened then and unfortunately still happens today.\n\n\n\n[In a recent episode, the "Gold Violin,"] the scene with my wife, it was just so poignant and painful, someone said to me that what she loved about the episode was that we clearly did love each other. We were like the gold violin, we were beautiful but we just didn\'t make music\n\n\n\nCNN: What would you like to see Hollywood do?\n\n\n\nBatt: Continue to reward good work and put positive role models out there. The one thing about "Brokeback Mountain" -- it was a beautifully filmed and acted film depicting a tortured relationship. The reason I thought the movie was so great is people walked away thinking, "Why couldn\'t they just be together?"\n\n\n\nThe more positive or interesting the portrayal of gay and lesbian characters, the better. They should show people who are living their good, healthy, responsible, productive lives as role models who just happen to be gay.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the subject.', 'qa': [{'question': 'where does he play', 'answers': ['Broadway', 'in nine Broadway and nine Off-Broadway productions,', '"Mad Men,"', 'Off-Broadway']}, {'question': 'What does Batt believe is beneficial?', 'answers': ['"We have to work toward acceptance on all levels,"']}, {'question': 'What TV series does Bryan Batt act in?', 'answers': ['"Mad Men,"']}, {'question': 'What does he beleive?', 'answers': ['"We have to work toward acceptance on all levels,"']}, {'question': 'who is bryan batt', 'answers': ['"Mad Men,"', 'an openly gay actor.', 'plays', 'cable TV series "Mad Men," has acted in nine Broadway and nine Off-Broadway productions, such as "Sunset Boulevard," "Beauty and the Beast," "Jeffrey" and "Starlight Express."', 'plays the closeted art director Salvatore Romano in the Emmy award-winning', 'plays the closeted art director Salvatore Romano', 'closeted art director Salvatore Romano in']}, {'question': 'what does batt believe', 'answers': ['acceptance', '"We have to work toward acceptance on all levels,"', 'gay']}, {'question': 'What still exists in Hollywood, according to Batt?', 'answers': ['homophobia']}, {'question': 'Eho is Bryan Batt?', 'answers': ['openly gay actor in Hollywood.', 'actor']}]}
{'text': '(CNN) -- Mike and Missy Wilson sat in a meeting late Tuesday afternoon, planning a ministry trip to Haiti when they were interrupted by a text message. A co-worker read the news: a powerful earthquake had just struck the Caribbean country.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn their Nashville, Tennessee, office, Mike Wilson said, "My heart just dropped" as he listened to the one-line bulletin. The quake\'s epicenter was a few miles from an orphanage in Carrefour, Haiti, where the Wilsons\' 21-year-old daughter Katie was working, and the 5-year-old girl they were about to adopt lived.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I felt like I couldn\'t take another breath," Missy Wilson said, "I jumped up and yelled, \'This can\'t be happening.\'"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first bits of news were discouraging, as sketchy reports came in of buildings collapsing and widespread destruction.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It was horrible," Missy Wilson said. "We spent hours trying to get any information."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brent Gambrell Ministries where she is director frequently works with churches and groups in Haiti. Any phone number they had in the country was quickly written on a board in the office.\n\n\n\n\n\n"A group of 20 (people) sat and dialed the numbers over and over and over again."\n\n\n\n\n\n"There are no words to explain that two people I love dearly were in the middle, and I couldn\'t reach then," Mike Wilson said, his voice cracking.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it was more than 24 hours before they finally got word. A brief, scratchy call from their daughter Katie came through -- she and 5-year-old Tia had survived the quake that destroyed the orphanage. Missy Wilson said Katie was able to say, "I\'m alive. We\'re safe. Tia\'s safe. Please just know we\'re alive," before the 40-second call was cut off.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be Thursday before the Wilsons learned the whole story. Mike Wilson, with two ministry officials, was able to travel into Haiti on a medivac plane, and the three made their way to the town.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There was destruction all around," he said from Haiti, "When I saw what was left of that building, I knew they were protected."\n\n\n\n\n\nKatie, Tia and 47 other children all made it out, but were living in the parking lot across from the shattered orphanage. When Mike Wilson finally found his daughter, she ran up to him at full speed and hugged him. "I can totally see her knocking him to the ground," her mother said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first order of business: a call home to a nervous mom. Wilson was able to get through on a rare working cell phone, and told his wife, "need to you to hear something."\n\n\n\n\n\nMissy Wilson said the next words were from Tia, barely able to speak English, saying, "\'Ma-ma, I love you.\' I started screaming at the top of my lungs."\n\n\n\n\n\nWilson and his colleagues brought food, water and supplies to the 200 quake victims in the parking lot. He described the injured, including one with a broken leg, being treated for two days in the heat with nothing more than an aspirin.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group arranged a bus to take the children to a guest house, a trip delayed when the bus broke down. But that news was minor, knowing they would have shelter and supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Wilsons, the next struggle is how to bring Tia home. They had been in Haiti just last week finishing paperwork for the adoption, but the office handling the case was destroyed in the quake. "All that paperwork, God knows where it is," Mike Wilson said. "That building was five stories, now it\'s five feet tall."\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Missy, waiting for news at home, "I feel like I\'m floating on top of my body."\n\n\n\n\n\n"Like I\'m living a dream and waiting to wake up," she said. This week has gone "from hopelessness to hope to tears to \'I can\'t take another phone call because I don\'t know what will happen,\'" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilson said he is working with the U.S. Embassy seeking emergency help to bring Tia to Nashville.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We are going to do it," he said, his voice the strongest it had been all day.', 'qa': [{'question': "Who is Wilson's daughter?", 'answers': ['Katie']}, {'question': 'What did the father travel to Haiti on?', 'answers': ['medivac plane,', 'a medivac plane,', "The quake's epicenter"]}, {'question': 'Who was in Haiti?', 'answers': ["the Wilsons' 21-year-old daughter Katie", "Wilsons' 21-year-old daughter Katie", 'and the 5-year-old girl they were about to adopt', 'Brent Gambrell Ministries']}, {'question': 'What age was the girl they were about to adopt?', 'answers': ['5-year-old']}, {'question': 'Where is the ophanage?', 'answers': ['Carrefour, Haiti,']}, {'question': 'Who made it out of the orphanage alive?', 'answers': ['Tia', 'Katie', 'Katie, Tia and 47 other children']}, {'question': 'Where did father travel?', 'answers': ['Haiti']}, {'question': 'What did Missy Wilson spend hours trying to get?', 'answers': ['information."', '"We spent', 'any information."', 'to']}]}

{'text': 'Bali, Indonesia (CNN) -- Defense Secretary Leon Panetta praised China on more than one occasion Sunday during a series of meetings with fellow defense ministers from southeast Asia, but hinted if relations between the United States and China worsen, it could be a threat to "the security of the world."\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said he appreciates China\'s muted response to the United States announcing a deal last month to sell more arms to Taiwan, and he lauded China for working with its neighbors with regards to the contentious issues involving the South China Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I would commend them for the way that they\'ve handled the news of that sale to Taiwan, compared to the past," Panetta told reporters after a meeting with Indonesia\'s defense minister Sunday in Bali.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province.

"I\'ve heard nothing that indicates that they\'re taking any steps in reaction to that," Panetta said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of the reason might be the way the United States government handled the sales. "It was something that the United States had announced but we had given the Chinese a heads up as to what was going to take place," Panetta said.

He said he met Thursday morning with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and that the president supports him.\n\n\n\nIn a July interview with the weekly French news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur, Sarkozy said he had read Mitterrand\'s book, and found it "courageous and talented."\n\n\n\nThe controversy over the revelations in his book -- which he called neither autobiography nor memoir -- erupted anew after Mitterrand deplored the arrest last week of filmmaker Roman Polanski, who fled the United States in 1977 after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl.\n\n\n\nThe culture minister told TF1 that he was "too emotional" when he denounced the filmmaker\'s arrest in Switzerland as "horrifying."\n\n\n\n"To see him thrown to the lions for an old story that really has no meaning, and to see him alone, imprisoned, when he was going to attend a ceremony where he was to be honored, that is to say, he was trapped, it\'s absolutely horrifying," he said October 4, according to Agence France Presse.\n\n\n\nThe far-right National Front organized an anti-Mitterrand demonstration in Paris on Thursday evening.\n\n\n\n"Send this message on to everyone who will not put up with this indecency!" the party\'s Web site said.\n\n\n\nThe party\'s vice president, Marine Le Pen, has demanded Mitterrand\'s resignation for what she termed his sexually deviant acts. Mitterrand responded, saying, "It\'s an honor to be dragged through the mud by the National Front."\n\n\n\nMitterrand\'s acts of "sexual tourism" have left "a dark smudge" on the government, Le Pen said.\n\n\n\nThe group is also gathering signatures on a petition, online and on paper, from those who want Mitterrand to step down.\n\n\n\n"We really hope he will resign," National Front communications director Julien Sanchez told CNN.\n\n\n\n"It\'s an embarrassment for our country, that our culture minister has done this. It affects our international image. It\'s not right," he added.  Watch report on the controversy surrounding French Culture Minister Frederic Mitterand »\n\n\n\nOn the other side of the political spectrum, the left-leaning Socialist Party suggested Sarkozy should consider Mitterrand\'s position.\n\n\n\n"It\'s up to President Sarkozy to decide whether or not we can be involved in the fight against child prostitution and sexual tourism, and whether or not the acts written in an autobiography -- written by a minister -- are acts of sexual commerce," said party spokesman Benoit Hamon.\n\n\n\n"If everything is relative and Mr. Mitterrand can be excused because he\'s famous, well, I don\'t excuse his behavior," Hamon said.\n\n\n\nMartine Aubry, the leader of the Socialist Party, said she would wait until she had read the book before making any judgment.\n\n\n\nMitterrand said on TF1 that he had had sexual relations with boys -- using the French word "garcons" -- but added, "you must not confuse pedophilia with homosexuality."\n\n\n\nHe also described his book as a mixture of his life and the life of others, and denied accusations that it was a glorification of sexual tourism. The minister said he never had sex with "young boys" and denounced those who accused him of such acts, saying that maybe they were confusing their own fantasies with what the book was really about.\n\n\n\nMitterrand told an interviewer in 2005 that assertions that he liked "little boys" were untrue.\n\n\n\n"It\'s because when people say \'boys\' we imagine \'little boys,\'" he said then. "How to explain that? It belongs to this general puritanism which surrounds us, which always makes us paint a black picture of the situation. It has nothing to do with that."\n\n\n\nMitterrand was a television personality, not a government minister, when the book was published. It caused a stir upon its publication, as well, and has been the subject of heated debate several times since then.\n\n\n\nIn one passage, published by the French newspaper Le Monde on Thursday, Mitterrand describes in detail a sexual encounter with a "boy" he said was called Bird.\n\n\n\n"My boy didn\'t say a word, he stood before me, immobile, his eyes still straight ahead and a half-smile on his lips. I wanted him so badly I was trembling," he wrote.\n\n\n\nMitterrand also wrote about visiting clubs to choose young male prostitutes in Thailand -- where prostitution is illegal and sexual intercourse with a minor is statutory rape and is punishable by imprisonment.\n\n\n\n"Most of them are young, handsome and apparently unaware of the devastation that their activities could bring them. I would learn later that they didn\'t come every night, that they were often students, had a girlfriend and sometimes even lived with their families, who pretended not to know the source of their breadwinner\'s earnings," the book said.\n\n\n\n"Some of them were older and there was also a small contingent of heavier bruisers, who also had their fans. It was the artistic side of the exposition: Their presence made the youthful charm of the others stand out."\n\n\n\nHe also wrote that while he had read reports and seen documentaries on the evils of "le commerce des garcons" (the boy trade) -- the misery, the piles of money from which "les gosses" (the kids) got only a few crumbs, the ravages of drugs -- "all of these rituals of the fair of the youths, the slave market, excited me enormously."\n\n\n\n"The profusion of very attractive boys, immediately available, put me in a state of desire that I no longer had to restrain or conceal."\n\n\n\nMitterrand -- the nephew of the Socialist former president Francois Mitterrand -- joined Sarkozy\'s center-right government this summer.\n\n\n\nWikipedia, the user-edited online reference Web site, has locked down Mitterrand\'s entry, preventing changes to it, in a possible sign of the intensity of the debate surrounding him.\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Jen Carswell in Paris, France and Alanne Orjoux in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What was published?', 'answers': ['autobiography, "The Bad Life."', 'the book', 'his 2005 autobiography, "The Bad Life."']}, {'question': 'what did he do for roman polanski', 'answers': ['deplored the arrest last week of filmmaker', 'deplored the arrest']}, {'question': 'What does hte minister condemn?', 'answers': ['sexual tourism,']}, {'question': 'what was written in the book', 'answers': ['accounts', 'paying to have sex with "boys" in Thailand.', 'mixture of his life and the life of others,', 'he wrote in 2005 about paying to have sex with "boys"', 'as']}, {'question': 'WHo wrote the book?', 'answers': ['Frederic Mitterrand', 'French Culture Minister Frederic Mitterrand']}, {'question': 'who came to the defense of Polanski after his arrest?', 'answers': ['Frederic Mitterrand', 'Mitterrand', 'Sarkozy']}, {'question': 'what has the culture minister denied', 'answers': ['accusations that it was a glorification of sexual tourism.', 'paying for sex with', '"boys"']}, {'question': 'what does the culture minister deny?', 'answers': ['sex with "boys" in Thailand.', 'said he never had sex with "young boys"', 'The', 'pedophilia," in which he insisted he has never participated.']}, {'question': 'who published excerpts from the book?', 'answers': ['Frederic Mitterrand', 'Le Monde']}]}

After all, this is a man who flew to India for one day to propose to her at the Taj Mahal when she was traveling there alone. This is also a man who summited the 14,400-foot Mount Rainier -- one of the most difficult climbs in the continental United States, and it combines the challenges of an unforgiving glacier with the unpredictability of an active volcano. That may be the best preparation Raj has for working in Washington these days."\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to his USAID biography, Shah, a medical doctor and health economist, was an under-secretary at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Prior to joining the Obama administration, Shah served as director of agricultural development at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2001, Shah was the health care policy adviser on the Gore 2000 presidential campaign and a member of Pennsylvania Gov.

The second house that I grew up in was down, and some relatives have died, from what I have been told," Jean-Louis said yesterday. "I haven\'t been able to reach my parents.

He moved to Paris, France, when he was 12 to pursue a modeling career and had supported his parents by sending money home since he started acting nearly 20 years ago. He is the founder of Hollywood Unites for Haiti, a nonprofit organization whose original mission was to provide sports and cultural education to underprivileged youth on the island.

Robertson, the host of the "700 Club," blamed the tragedy on something that "happened a long time ago in Haiti, and people might not want to talk about it." The Haitians "were under the heel of the French. You know, Napoleon III and whatever," Robertson said on his broadcast Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n"And they got together and swore a pact to the devil.

Brown is hoping to become the first Massachusetts Republican to win a U.S. Senate seat since 1972.

His family did not reveal details about his illness, but said it was related to complications from a 1982 car accident, Barbaris said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crooner, affectionately known as just "Teddy" by many fans, started in music with a group called the Cadillacs in the late 1960s and was still with the group when it merged with Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, according to his official Web site. He began as a drummer, but soon became the lead singer after the group heard his powerful voice. In 1972, Pendergrass\' baritone could be heard on the classic Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes song "If You Don\'t Know Me by Now."\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter going solo, Pendergrass received several Grammy nominations, Billboard\'s 1977 Pop Album New Artist Award, and an American Music Award for best R&B performer of 1978, Barbaris said. In 1982, Pendergrass was involved in a car accident that left him paralyzed. But he returned to the studio in 1984 in his wheelchair to record an album. Before his death, Pendergrass was working on a musical documenting his life, called "I Am Who I Am."\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: R&B singer Teddy Pendergrass dies at 59\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes a person intriguing?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different.

{'text': 'WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans.\n\n\n\nE-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals.\n\n\n\nKnown as "e-cigarettes," the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum.\n\n\n\nWhile manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a "healthy way" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user.\n\n\n\n"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public," said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA.\n\n\n\nCNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere, one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes, after the FDA announcement, and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment.\n\n\n\nBecause e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user. That is why the FDA began to test them.\n\n\n\nThe FDA\'s Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes. In releasing its information, the FDA did not identify the two companies, but said in one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected. Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them, the FDA said.\n\n\n\nThe FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008. To date, 50 shipments have been stopped. The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\n\n\n"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, "but to say they are healthy -- that\'s highly doubtful."\n\n\n\nSamet and other health experts attended the FDA announcement on its findings.\n\n\n\nDr. Jonathan Winickoff, chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Tobacco Consortium, said parents need to be aware of e-cigarettes. "It is very important that parents let their children know these are not safe and to make recommendations, or even enforce rules that they not be used," he said.\n\n\n\n"Children who use these products may also be using other tobacco products," said Dr. Matthew McKenna, director of the Office of Smoking and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "It\'s a good idea to make sure the child is aware of the dangers of tobacco in products in general."\n\n\n\nThe FDA has been challenged regarding its jurisdiction over certain e-cigarettes in a case pending in federal court.

{'text': 'Atlanta (CNN) -- Ryan Brunn, the man who this week was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to murdering a Georgia girl, apparently killed himself in his prison cell Thursday, a corrections spokeswoman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia Department of Corrections spokeswoman Kristen Stancil said that Brunn was found unresponsive at 4:15 p.m. in his cell at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson. Brunn was pronounced dead at a hospital at 5:37 p.m. due to an apparent suicide, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case since has been referred to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, according to Stancil.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrunn had entered a guilty plea Tuesday at a hearing in a Cherokee County courthouse, during which he described in detail how he enticed, molested and killed 7-year-old Jorelys Rivera. He was subsequently sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole, avoiding a potential death sentence by lethal injection.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe girl\'s father, Ricardo Galarza, told CNN en Espanol that news of Brunn\'s death partly made him "feel good but, on the other hand, it doesn\'t because my daughter will never be with me again."\n\n\n\n\n\nGalarza said that he felt that a lifetime of Brunn being watched after, "eating three times a day (and) sleeping with air conditioning" while in prison was not enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n"What I wanted was for them to put him in the electric chair and burn him," the father said.

{'text': '(CNN) -- "A calculated, cold-blooded predator." That was how Connecticut Judge James Bentivegna described a then 22-year-old Joshua Komisarjevsky on December 20, 2002, when the defendant was sentenced after being convicted on 12 counts of burglary.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Komisarjevsky -- now 31 -- sits in a Connecticut courtroom, where a jury will weigh his guilt on murder charges, and potentially pave the way for a death sentence.\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutors say that on July 23, 2007, Komisarjevsky and an accomplice, Steven Hayes, invaded the home of Dr. William Petit, raped and strangled his wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, molested one of their daughters, and set the house on fire before attempting to flee.\n\n\n\n\n\nHawke-Petit and her daughters -- 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit -- died in the invasion of their Cheshire, Connecticut, home. Dr. William Petit, although severely beaten, managed to escape and crawl to a neighbor\'s residence.\n\n\n\n\n\nHayes was sentenced to death in December, after being convicted of 16 out of the 17 charges related to the three deaths.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth suspects had lengthy criminal records when they were arrested for the Petit invasion. Komisarjevsky\'s long rap sheet, in particular, suggest that he was a troubled young man with a penchant for nighttime burglary and crystal meth.\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials with the Connecticut Board of Pardons and Paroles declined to speak with CNN, citing a gag order in the case. But over 200 pages of Komisarjevsky\'s parole records have been released, which -- along with previous court testimony -- help paint a picture of the accused.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of his former attorneys, William Gerace, said that Komisarjevsky came from a close, religious family. But at the age of 14, he began using drugs -- the same year, he claims, that he found out that he was adopted.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 18, Komisarjevsky had found his drugs of choice: crystal meth and cocaine. He told the parole board that he stole money and electronics from upscale homes to feed his drug habit.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet a transcript from his 2002 sentencing paints Komisarjevsky as more than just the average thief. According to a police statement read aloud in court that day, Komisarjevsky admitted that he broke into his first house when he was 14 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I always wore gloves, with the exception of one incident when I was 14. I always acted alone. Approximately a year and a half ago, I acquired night vision goggles... I used the night-vision equipment during the burglaries (over) the past year," he said, according to the transcript.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerace, who was Komisarjevsky\'s defense attorney at the time, stressed that a need for money, to pay for drugs, drove his client. But he admitted that the way he went about it was unusual.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Ninety-nine percent of burglaries are (committed by) junkies -- there\'s nothing romantic about what they do," said Gerace. "That was the first time I\'d seen something as exotic as that."\n\n\n\n\n\nKomisarjevsky confessed that he only broke into homes at night and never during the day -- a point stressed by prosecutors in the 2002 trial. They said his affinity for breaking into people\'s homes at night showed that he wanted a confrontation, since that was the time when the residents were the most likely to be at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking during his December 2002 sentencing, Komisarjevsky appeared repentant. He addressed the court saying, "I\'ve turned my back on my faith in God and my family. And in doing so, I fell flat on my face and deep into hard drugs...the crimes I committed was weighing so heavily on my shoulders."\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the judge was not moved by Komisarjevsky\'s show of remorse, sentencing him to nine years in prison plus six years of special parole, which has greater restrictions than typical probation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April 2007, he was paroled. And three months later, Komisarjevsky was arrested for the Petit home invasion and murders.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened then, and what may have driven Komisarjevsky, remains a mystery to Gerace, his former attorney.\n\n\n\n\n\n"He was a very complex young man. I don\'t think I\'ve met anyone quite that complex, and I sensed there was an abundance of issues that had to be dealt with," Gerace said.

And amenities such as Internet access and a hot tub at the hostel add creature comforts to the trip.\n\n\n\nWampach\'s travel habits are consistent with a growing number of travelers called "flashpackers."\n\n\n\nThey are usually over 30, in mid-to-late career and can afford higher-end hotels but instead choose budget options -- albeit better-furnished and well-kept ones -- because it fits their lifestyle, said Mark Vidalin, Marketing Director for Hostelling International USA, a nonprofit network of hostels. Flashpackers also tend to stay connected by traveling with gadgets and seeking accommodations with free Wi-Fi, Vidalin said.\n\n\n\nThe term "flashpacker" likely originated in Australia, and combines the term "flash" -- meaning "stylish" -- with "backpacker," according to Vidalin.\n\n\n\nFlashpackers and regular backpackers are booking hostels at U.S. vacation destinations in full force this year. Attendance at hostels has been consistently rebounding from lows following the September 11, 2001.\n\n\n\nThis year\'s turbulent economy appears to be fueling demand for hostel space.\n\n\n\nHeading into ski season, Loree Weisman, the owner of the Crested Butte International Lodge and Hostel in Crested Butte, Colorado, said her hostel bookings are trending ahead of the town\'s other lodging options -- and up about 25 percent from her bookings by the same time last year.\n\n\n\nAmid the unsteady economy, she said, people "don\'t want to give up a vacation, but they might need to adapt a vacation."\n\n\n\nInstead of canceling pricey vacations due to economic fears, many travelers are rejecting accommodations with private bedrooms and bathrooms.\n\n\n\nThey\'re going for hostels with their dorm-style bunk beds, community bathrooms, and, most importantly for many hostel dwellers, shared living spaces.\n\n\n\n"There\'s a sense of community, and there\'s a social aspect to it that\'s pretty significant," said Jim Williams, editor of "The Hostel Handbook" and a former hostel owner. "That is the heart of hostelling. You don\'t go to a hotel and lock the door."\n\n\n\nWampach agreed, saying that hostels offer "a tremendous way to meet people from different cultures and talk to people you wouldn\'t normally talk to."\n\n\n\nBut the communal atmosphere of hostels leaves many travelers skeptical, particularly Americans, Williams said.\n\n\n\n"Americans have privacy issues. If you suggested to most people they were going to share a room with five other people, most of them wouldn\'t want to do it," he said.\n\n\n\nWhat if a roommate snores or what if he smells or doesn\'t stop talking? -- these are legitimate questions for travelers considering the hostel option, said Williams.\n\n\n\nFrequent hostel dweller Mandy Creighton, 30, said she enjoys the overall hostel experience, but it\'s a "huge challenge" to "walk through the room and to my room without having to talk to 20 people."\n\n\n\nCreighton and her partner, Ryan Mlynarczyk, 32, who are documentary filmmakers from Sebastopol, California, are bicycling around the United States for a year and stopping in ecologically sustainable communities along the way.\n\n\n\nTheir choice to stay in hostels is rooted in a desire to maintain a green lifestyle by sharing resources as well as saving money.\n\n\n\nMlynarczyk experienced the other side of the privacy issue when he stepped out of a shower in a San Francisco, California, hostel to discover he had a female audience.\n\n\n\n"I ... didn\'t have my towel on -- and some girl walks in and was like, \'Woo!\' I\'m totally open to that sort of thing, but I think she was a little bit new to it, and she kind of was giggling. But obviously the immediate reaction was, \'Oh my God!\' " Mlynarczyk said.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to Americans who treasure their personal space, the communal environment is more ingrained in European culture, experts said.\n\n\n\nIt\'s possible to trace that cultural divide to post-World War II, said Williams, when Europe underwent its financial recovery in the 1950s and its culture was more communal. On the other hand, the U.S. economy was booming, and there was no need for Americans to share resources.\n\n\n\n"At the same time [Europeans] were creating hostels, American teenagers were focused on getting their own cars," Williams said.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Hostelling International reported its hostels in many destination cities saw notable increases in October versus the same time last year: New York overnight guests increased by 9.8 percent, Washington by 9.7 percent and San Diego, California, by 22.1 percent, according to Hostelling International.\n\n\n\nDespite the rise in many hostel bookings, Williams said hostelling still isn\'t part of mainstream American culture.\n\n\n\n"We do hostelling about as well as we do soccer. We do it, but it\'s a limited market, and we do it a certain way. Otherwise, most Americans aren\'t very comfortable [with] it," Williams said.\n\n\n\nWampach said he believes this represents Americans\' "relatively conservative views and lifestyles."\n\n\n\nBut people are respectful of each other\'s space, he said, and they rarely spend time together in the dorm room aside from sleeping anyway.\n\n\n\n"You just do your best; everybody understands you are who are," Wampach said. "Sometimes you get a guy who snores but ... that\'s part of the deal."', 'qa': [{'question': 'What are "flashpackers"?', 'answers': ['meaning "stylish"', 'instead choose budget options', 'with "backpacker,"', 'mid-to-late career and can afford higher-end hotels but', 'Wampach\'s travel habits are consistent with a growing number of travelers called "flashpackers."', 'usually over 30, in mid-to-late career and can afford higher-end hotels but', '30,']}, {'question': 'Are Americans comfortable about hostels ?', 'answers': ["aren't very", 'most', '"Americans have privacy issues.', '[with] it,"']}, {'question': 'What about hostels do many Americans find uncomfortable?', 'answers': ['travelers skeptical, particularly', 'the communal atmosphere', 'communal atmosphere of', 'privacy issues.', 'leaves']}, {'question': 'What are flashpackers?', 'answers': ['meaning "stylish"', 'The term "flashpacker" likely originated in Australia, and combines the term "flash" -- meaning "stylish" -- with "backpacker,"', 'instead choose budget options', 'with "backpacker,"', 'over 30, in mid-to-late career and can afford higher-end hotels but', 'and regular backpackers are booking hostels at U.S. vacation destinations', 'They are usually over 30, in mid-to-late career and can afford higher-end hotels but']}, {'question': 'What are many Americans uncomfortable with?', 'answers': ['the communal atmosphere of hostels']}, {'question': 'What is the "heart of hostelling"?', 'answers': ['"There\'s a sense of community, and there\'s a social aspect to it that\'s pretty significant,"', 'You don\'t go to a hotel and lock the door."']}, {'question': 'What is a "flashpacker" ?', 'answers': ['meaning "stylish"', 'instead choose budget options', 'with "backpacker,"', 'They are usually over 30, in mid-to-late career and can afford higher-end hotels but', 'Wampach\'s travel habits are consistent with a growing number of travelers called "flashpackers."']}, {'question': 'What is the heart of hostelling?', 'answers': ['a social aspect', '"There\'s a sense of community, and there\'s a social aspect to it that\'s pretty significant,"', 'Crested Butte International Lodge and Hostel in Crested Butte, Colorado,', 'sense of community,']}]}
{'text': '(CNN)  -- With his hands and feet shackled and his face obscured by his long hair, Chester Arthur Stiles made his initial court appearance in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Wednesday morning on charges stemming from the videotaped rape of a 2-year-old girl.\n\nChester Stiles appears Wednesday in a Las Vegas, Nevada, courtroom.\n\nStiles, 37, was taken into custody Monday night after a Henderson, Nevada, police officer pulled over the white Buick Century he was driving.\n\nProsecutors added a couple more charges before Wednesday\'s hearing, bringing the total to 23 felony counts, including a charge of lewdness with a minor, sexual assault and the use of a child in the production of pornography, according to a statement issued by the Clark County, Nevada, court.\n\nOne of the lewdness charges stems from a 2004 incident, while the others are related to the videotape, the court said.\n\nJudge Deborah Lippis set November 19 as the date for the preliminary hearing.\n\nAfter the hearing, Stiles\' court-appointed attorney said his client was overwhelmed by the public opinion in the case.\n\n"I think he\'s a little out of it," public defender Jeff Banks said.\n\nJerry T. Donohue, the attorney for the girl\'s mother, told CNN that the child on the videotape was younger than 3 when the abuse occurred. The girl, who is now 7, was found last month after a nationwide search.\n\nThe girl\'s mother said on "The Dr. Phil Show" Wednesday that she was "relieved" about Stiles\' arrest, although it would have been "better if they found him dead."\n\nThe woman said she will testify against Stiles if the case goes to court.\n\nShe told Phil McGraw that her daughter remembers nothing about the videotaped assault and that she recently had a conversation with the girl about inappropriate touching.\n\nShe said her daughter told her that if someone touched her inappropriately, the girl would scream and tell her mother.\n\nBut, she told McGraw, "I don\'t trust anybody now."\n\nAlthough she is in a relationship with a man her daughter calls "Dad," she said, "I don\'t feel comfortable leaving her with him, nor with anybody else. ... I just cry and blame it on myself."\n\nEight-and-a-half months pregnant, she said the incident has placed a lot of strain on her.\n\nAsked if she would rather not have known about the assault, she said, "Yes, I could have lived without knowing it."\n\nA former girlfriend of Stiles\' said that, before the arrest, she lived in fear after going to police to identify the suspect after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news.\n\n"I\'ve had my share of nightmares," Elaine Thomas told CNN\'s Nancy Grace.\n\nThomas said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television and had no choice but to contact police about the man she had thought was a "weapons enthusiast" with only a minor criminal record.  Watch Thomas say how she felt when she saw the photos »\n\n"How could I not tell them who that man was? That little girl suffered unimaginable things, and I knew for a fact it was him," Thomas said.\n\nAnother former girlfriend of Stiles\', Tina Allen, said this month she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is "mortified" by the allegations against him.\n\n"He said he\'d been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be," Allen said.\n\nAllen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived.\n\nAlso living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, the alleged assault victim.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Three attacks were made on Royal Dutch Shell oil facilities in Nigeria on Sunday, according to a company spokesman who said details were not immediately available.\n\n\n\nInvestigating the attacks will be difficult because they happened in remote areas, Royal Dutch Shell says.\n\n\n\nThe attacks were against pipelines in the eastern part of the Niger Delta in Nigeria, said the spokesman, Rainer Winzenried.\n\n\n\n"Shell is investigating the impact on facilities, the environment and the production capabilities," he said.\n\n\n\nThe attacks happened in remote areas, making investigations difficult, he said, adding that the company would not send in investigators until it was certain the area was secure. It was not known whether there were any casualties, he said.\n\n\n\nThe pipelines are part of a Shell joint venture that provides oil to several companies, Winzenried said. Shell runs the venture, and Nigeria is the operator.\n\n\n\nWinzenried refused to speculate on who was behind the attacks, but Nigeria\'s main militant group -- the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND -- said it had attacked an offshore facility earlier Sunday and that "the structure is ... engulfed in fire."\n\n\n\nWinzenried had no information about that claim.\n\n\n\nMEND, which demands a fairer distribution of Nigeria\'s oil wealth, claimed Friday that it destroyed a pipeline owned and operated by the Italian gas company Agip, but Agip has not confirmed that report.\n\n\n\nEarlier in the week, MEND claimed to have destroyed Royal Dutch Shell\'s main trunk line in Bayelsa state and a Chevron oil station in the delta region. Shell confirmed an attack on that pipeline and said it had shut it down to avoid an environmental impact. Chevron, which halted its onshore operations in the region last month, said it was investigating.\n\n\n\nLast month, the militant group declared an "all-out war" on the government after what it said was a deadly bombing raid on civilians.\n\n\n\nIt is not the first declaration of war by MEND, which demands that more of Nigeria\'s oil wealth be invested in the region instead of enriching those whom the militants consider corrupt politicians.\n\n\n\nThe militant group declared war against the government in September for what it said were unprovoked attacks. At that time, MEND destroyed several oil facilities, forcing Nigeria to cut its oil exports by as many as 1 million barrels of oil per day, or 40 percent.', 'qa': [{'question': 'who attacked the pipelines?', 'answers': ['Winzenried refused to speculate on', 'was behind the attacks,', 'refused to speculate on']}, {'question': 'Who was resposible for the attack?', 'answers': ["but Nigeria's", 'the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND -- said it had attacked an offshore facility earlier Sunday and that "the structure is ... engulfed in fire."', 'behind the', 'Winzenried refused to speculate on', 'main militant group -- the Movement']}, {'question': 'Who would run the investigation?', 'answers': ['Royal Dutch Shell']}, {'question': 'What will make the investigation hard?', 'answers': ['The attacks happened in remote areas,']}, {'question': 'where is the pipeline?', 'answers': ['in the eastern part of the Niger Delta in Nigeria,', 'Nigeria,', 'eastern part of the Niger Delta in Nigeria,']}, {'question': 'Where were the Pipelines attacked?', 'answers': ['Niger Delta in Nigeria,', 'eastern part of', 'Nigeria']}, {'question': 'who claimed responsiblity?', 'answers': ['the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND', 'MEND', 'Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta,']}, {'question': 'What group took responsibility for attacking an offshore facility?', 'answers': ['the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND', 'Movement']}]}

{'text': '(CNN) -- As hosts of the largest carnival in world football, the pressure is on for South Africa\'s national football team to ignite the imagination of local fans by performing well at the 2010 World Cup.\n\n\n\nIf Bafana Bafana is to succeed in their mission, conventional wisdom would be that coach Carlos Alberto Parreira will turn to his best players to deliver results.\n\n\n\nHowever, despite firing in 31 goals in 77 appearances to become South Africa\'s all-time record goal scorer, Benni McCarthy has had question marks hanging over his participation for his country come June.\n\n\n\nThe prolific striker, who plays for English Premier League side Blackburn Rovers, has only recently returned from a period of international exile, just the latest incident in a stormy history with his country\'s football team.\n\n\n\nHe first angered Bafana Bafana fans by going into international retirement in 2002 aged just 25. The reason? Traveling to international games was hampering his ability to play European football for Celta Vigo and, later, Porto.\n\n\n\n"The whole pattern was killing my career, that\'s why I quit international football," he told British newspaper The Independent in 2004. "African football needs the same calendar as Europe otherwise its best players are going to suffer."\n\n\n\nHe was talked into returning, only to quit again after the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations when the president of the South African FA, Mubarak Mahomad, made an uncomplimentary comment about his performance.\n\n\n\nThat period of self-imposed exile lasted 20 months, until new coach Carlos Alberto Parreira flew to Great Britain to talk to McCarthy, who was now at Blackburn Rovers. But after Parreira quit to care for his sick wife, McCarthy fell out with replacement boss Joel Santana after he refused to play in two warm up matches last March.\n\n\n\nDespite pleas from South African President Jacob Zuma, Santana refused to pick him. But a run of eight defeats in nine games, which saw the team slump to 86th on the FIFA rankings, Santana was sacked. With goals being South Africa\'s biggest problem, it was no surprise that returning coach Parreira made persuading McCarthy to return, for a second time, his top priority.\n\n\n\nSure enough, McCarthy returned to the fray last month against Japan. The 32-year-old told local press: "I want to start afresh and help Bafana do well in the World Cup finals. It is every player\'s dream to play for his country... and I have matured."\n\n\n\n"In the past I was a loose cannon and I apologize if I was wrong [but] I am still the best at what I do - and that is scoring goals," he added.\n\n\n\nFew could argue with McCarthy\'s record. Born in Hanover Park, an impoverished township in Cape Town known for its high unemployment, poverty and gang-related violence, McCarthy escaped to become one of Africa\'s most successful football exports.\n\n\n\nMcCarthy started his career in 1995 aged 18 with Seven Stars of Cape Town, where 27 goals in 29 games earned him a move to Cape Town Spurs who soon merged with Ajax Cape Town, a feeder side to their famous Dutch namesake.\n\n\n\nMcCarthy\'s potential was enough for Ajax Amsterdam to sign him. Joining in 1997 he scored nine goals to help them win the Eredivisie in his first year, which eventually attracted the attentions of Spain\'s Celta Vigo.\n\n\n\nAlthough it didn\'t work out in Spain, his move to Portugal\'s FC Porto was a roaring success. In the 2003/04 season he helped Jose Mourinho\'s side win the UEFA Champions League with McCarthy memorably grabbing two goals in the second round defeat of Manchester United.\n\n\n\nMcCarthy moved to Premier League outfit Blackburn Rovers in 2006 and scored plenty of goals - he was in the top three league scorers in his debut season - but first-team opportunities have been limited of late.\n\n\n\nYet ever since McCarthy made his international debut in a 2-0 home defeat to Holland 1997, South Africa has been a different side with him in it. Gloom has followed South Africa\'s footballing exploits before this summer\'s World Cup. But after his most recent \'comeback\', Bafana Bafana fans will hope that McCarthy can help put the dark days under Joel Santana firmly behind them.\n\n\n\nHear what Benni has to say in CNN\'s coverage of the World Cup draw, live on Friday 4th December.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What other teams has McCarthy played for?', 'answers': ['Celta Vigo', 'Porto.']}, {'question': 'Who does McCarthy currently play for?', 'answers': ['English Premier League', 'Blackburn Rovers', 'World Cup', "South Africa's"]}, {'question': 'on what team McCarthy is playing for currently?', 'answers': ["South Africa's", 'Premier League outfit Blackburn Rovers']}, {'question': 'Who are leading  score?', 'answers': ['Benni McCarthy']}, {'question': 'In what day was World Cup Draw?', 'answers': ['World Cup draw, live on Friday 4th December', 'Friday 4th December']}, {'question': 'how many goals did McCarthy scored?', 'answers': ['31']}, {'question': "on what date and day the south african legend Benni McCarthy is taking part of CNN's World cup Draw coverage?", 'answers': ['Friday 4th December']}, {'question': 'How many goals has McCarthy scored for Bafana?', 'answers': ['31']}, {'question': 'What plays McCarthy?', 'answers': ['The prolific striker,', 'for English Premier League side Blackburn Rovers,', 'football']}]}

{'text': 'Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- An English tourist kidnapped from a remote Kenyan resort is being held by pirates in a remote corner of Somalia, according to experts and security analysts in Nairobi.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Gangs from Southern Somalia took her up the coast and then moved her several times," said Andrew Mwangura, a piracy expert and maritime editor of Somalia Report, an independent online publication.\n\n\n\n\n\nJudith Tebbutt was abducted by armed men from a remote safari lodge near to the Somali border earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer husband, David Tebbutt, was killed in the attack when he resisted, according to Kenyan police.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Kenyan man has been charged in connection with the attack, a lawyer familiar with the case told CNN Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nAli Babitu Kololo, who worked at the luxury resort in Kiwayu where the attack took place, was charged with robbery with violence and abducting with the intention to murder, according to a lawyer present at the hearing at the Lamu law courts.\n\n\n\n\n\nKololo pleaded not guilty to both counts.\n\n\n\n\n\nA second man, Issa Sheck Saadi, is expected to appear in court at a later date.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails of the incident are still sketchy and the British government has asked journalists not to reveal the exact location of Tebbutt to avoid abduction attempts from rival gangs.\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, it was feared that al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked militant group, had conducted the operation as a revenge attack against the British nationals.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a security analyst based in Nairobi, who tracks piracy operations but is not authorized to speak to the media, also believes this is the work of pirates.\n\n\n\n\n\n"This is not the work of al-Shabaab," he said, "this is the work of southern armed gangs and pirates."\n\n\n\n\n\nNo ransom demands have been made yet, says Mwangura.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if Somali pirates carried out the operation, it represents a marked departure in tactics.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor years, pirates have attacked commercial ships in the busy shipping lanes between Europe and Asia.

"It\'s significant if you place it in the context of the struggle against piracy.

{'text': 'Miami, Florida (CNN) -- He lies in a bed on a balloon-type mattress, to reduce pressure on his burned body. He is covered with bandages; a ventilator breathes for Michael Brewer because he can\'t do it for himself.\n\n\n\nHe\'s hooked up to the marvels of modern medicine that are trying to give the 15-year-old burn victim a chance to be a kid once again.\n\n\n\nSixty-five percent of his body is covered with second- and third-degree burns.\n\n\n\n"People are writing horror stories ... but people just can\'t imagine the kind of sickness we\'re talking about," said Dr. Nicholas Namias, medical director of the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center in Miami.\n\n\n\n"I\'ve been to movies like everyone else, and Hollywood hasn\'t even thought of something like this," Namias said.\n\n\n\nBrewer is heavily sedated, and the ventilator does not allow him to speak. His open wounds are covered by bandages, which are changed daily. It\'s a four-hour process.\n\n\n\nHe has not been able to speak with police since his desperate fight for life began October 12, when police say five teenage friends, including a 13-year-old, doused Brewer with rubbing alcohol and set him on fire.\n\n\n\nThe attack occurred after Brewer reported to police that one of the youths had stolen his father\'s bicycle. Police say the bicycle was stolen because Brewer did not pay one of the boys $40 for a video game.\n\n\n\nAccording to police, witnesses said the teens called Brewer "a snitch" as they used a lighter to set him ablaze.\n\n\n\nNamias explained how Brewer\'s organs are not functioning the way they should be, but that is expected at this early stage of recovery.\n\n\n\n"He\'s still on the ventilator and advanced modes of mechanical ventilation. We are breathing for him. His contribution to the breathing is trivial," Namias said.\n\n\n\nNamias also explained that in burn cases, words must be chosen carefully when talking about patients and their condition because so much is at risk and so much can change quickly.\n\n\n\n"When you say he\'s doing OK, in this situation it means he\'s alive and responding to treatments," Namias said. "We\'re still dealing with the respiratory failure. We\'re dealing with infection now and the need to supply the massive amount of nutrition that this person needs to survive."\n\n\n\nOn Monday, the five teens who are accused of taking part in the attack appeared separately before judges in Broward County, Florida.\n\n\n\nState prosecutors were granted additional time to build their case. Formal charges are expected later this month. For now, all five teens are being held in custody.\n\n\n\nFour of the boys, all 15 years old, could be charged as adults. The 13-year-old also could be charged as an adult but under Florida law only if Brewer dies.\n\n\n\nMichael Brewer\'s parents, Valerie and Michael Brewer Sr., issued a written statement through the hospital last week. They are not granting interviews.\n\n\n\n"The recovery process will be baby steps, but eventually he will be whole again," they wrote.\n\n\n\nBut their son\'s injuries enter the realm of medicine and science that has no guarantee.\n\n\n\n"There\'s no evolutionary mechanism to survive a 65 percent burn," Namias said.\n\n\n\n"Surviving is a miracle of modern medicine and about the technology and the things we do. This is not like a gunshot and you come out of the [operating room], and say everything\'s going to be OK," he added.\n\n\n\n"We never give up, and we never predict it. ... Our expectation is survival."\n\n\n\nAcross the hospital floor in the burn unit at Jackson Memorial Hospital, six other people\'s lives also are at stake: all victims of various accidents, all with burns similar to Michael Brewer\'s. They, too, are trying to regain at least a part of what they used to have.\n\n\n\n"It\'s understandable that people can be burned in accidents," Namias said.\n\n\n\n"But this was no accident.

{'text': '(CNN) -- First it was instant messaging during office hours that gave us the thrill of passing notes in class. Then it was ogling ourselves on Web cams, ranting our minds on blogs, uploading our baby photos on Flickr and poking each other on Facebook. These days, as corporate records show, we choose to spend our lunch breaks watching YouTube, if not chatting over Skype.\n\n\n\nCSL\'s flagship One2Free shop stands at the corner of Hong Kong\'s trendy Causeway Bay district.\n\n\n\nThe bad news is the Web 2.0 revolution is over. The good news is now we can take it with us.\n\n\n\nOver the past two years, well over a dozen startups have sprung into action, bringing everything from IM to VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) to our mobile phones, in a quest to conquer the cellular fourth screen.\n\n\n\nWinner of Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal\'s 2007 Emerging Technologies Awards in the category of Social Networking, Mig33 is confident about the viability of its future: "The next wave of Internet growth is mobile. The number of mobile devices worldwide has exceeded three billion, and the next billion subscribers will have their first Internet experience using a mobile phone."\n\n\n\nLike the Rotterdam-based Nimbuzz, Mig33 also offers instant messaging, photo sharing and VoIP for cheaper telephony, in addition to social networking via profiles, chatrooms and, of course, friends.\n\n\n\nApplications are free to download and communities are free to join, while members are charged only for SMS and VoIP calls, bridging communications between mobile devices and desktop computers.\n\n\n\nThe softwares are fully functional on both 3G and any smart (Internet-enabled) 2.5G phones running such platforms as Java, Symbian, Windows Mobile, Blackberry, S60 and the iPhone OS.\n\n\n\nNimbuzz in particular boasts compatibility with Skype, Google Talk, AOL Instant Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo! Live Messenger, Jabber, MySpace and Facebook. But it is hardly alone in partnering with traditional desktop live chat sites, as well as industry partners around the world.\n\n\n\nPlayfully packaged, internationally-based Fring works with WiFi providers in Europe and Australia as well as SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) providers based in both North and South America, Western and Eastern Europe, South Africa and China, also consolidating all chat buddies into a single mobile contact list.\n\n\n\nIn this context, one way to stand out from the all-encompassing bunch with the global reach is through niche audience focus.\n\n\n\nMyHappyPlanet, a free online language-exchange network that allows members to create profiles and chat with language partners in real time (text, voice, video), will go mobile in the near future.\n\n\n\nA2Aworld, an upcoming mobile social networking startup, will focus on connecting social networkers between the world\'s two largest online communities -- America and Asia -- in terms of communication, information, culture and e-commerce. Furthermore, its business model is based on revenue from emerging online advertising, VoIP calls and premium membership fees, without the mobile ads and viral marketing.\n\n\n\nFierce competition\n\n\n\nMeanwhile in the mobile marketplace, VoIP competition is getting fierce. While SIPphone\'s open-source Gizmo Project was heralded by early beta testers as "the first viable Skype alternative" in July 2005, it\'s clear today that Skype itself is the big winner in the VoIP game.\n\n\n\nMost recently, iSkoot has extended its partnership with Skype, following its collaboration with mobile operator 3 for the global launch of the 3 Skypephone in October 2007, which was the first mass-market Skype-enabled handset as a carrier-integrated solution for mobile-VoIP IM services.\n\n\n\nBut mobile VoIP itself still faces multiple challenges, including fragmented access and distribution. While some applications choose to collaborate with mobile network carriers, others choose to compete with them by using data networks such as WiFi.\n\n\n\n"In the near future, there will be a hyper-convergence solution," predicts A2Aworld\'s Michael Liu. "However, WiFi/WiMax to cell/IMS will be playing a bigger and bigger role. In the long run, there will be all-in-IP IMS solutions."\n\n\n\nInsecure communications also pose a new threat to VoIP, as Liu points out: "In the early days of VoIP, people were mostly concerned with its cost, functionality and reliability. Now that VoIP is gaining wide acceptance and becoming one of the mainstream communication technologies, security has become a major issue."\n\n\n\nAnd to satisfy the YouTube generation, applications such as myZen Mobile encourage the circulation of photos and viral videos optimized for mobile viewing in real time, with an all-in-one interface featuring YouTube, Facebook, Flickr, Yahoo podcast, etc, with the possibility to add other community sites such as ifilm and blogger.\n\n\n\nGoing mobile\n\n\n\nSimon Newstead, founder and CEO of Frenzoo, a social-networking site specialized in 3D fashion avatars, is enthusiastic about going mobile.\n\n\n\n"We have a roadmap to implement our service on mobile platforms such as iPhone," he says. "Today users are already using 3D in gaming platforms like the wildly successful Nintendo DS Lite, so the logical integration of 3D avatars into the mobile platform will certainly present a great opportunity.\n\n\n\n"Technically, new handsets already integrate hardware acceleration for 3G, and battery life is increasing rapidly. Now the only remaining factor is availability or higher-speed affordable mobile bandwidth, which is already emerging in advanced mobile markets such as South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan."\n\n\n\nIndeed in Hong Kong, where the mobile-phone penetration rate hovers around 150 percent, mastering the mobile market is becoming increasingly lucrative.\n\n\n\nHong Kong\'s largest mobile network carrier CSL introduced Asia\'s first 3G video-sharing service in 2005, launched Hong Kong\'s first 3G interactive mobile TV in 2006, and partnered with blogging site Xanga in early 2008.\n\n\n\nFrom the carrier\'s point of view, people\'s choice of mobile communication is a question of coverage and user-friendliness -- of "price, packaging, usability," according to CSL\'s ("Create a Simple Life") chief marketing officer Christina Teo.\n\n\n\n"We try to \'replicate\' any desktop experience to the mobile phone. You can call it replicating, extending, adding value," continues Teo. "And with every new partnership, we need to make sure that the application works on each new handset we launch... With mobile phones [as opposed to desktop computers] there is still some concern, stigma, so we need to educate people to get over that hurdle. It\'s the faster we can get it at the click of a button."\n\n\n\nMore and more, the mission of the mobile industry is to make seamless that virtual space between desktop and handset.\n\n\n\n"It\'s where we want people to embrace life," says Teo. "It\'s what we all aim to do. No downtime, no downspace...

{'text': '(CNN) -- Early in Michael Mann\'s vivid, incisive, but half-cocked gangster opus "Public Enemies," Johnny Depp\'s John Dillinger returns to jail a few scant months after leaving it.\n\n\n\nJohnny Depp plays the charismatic John Dillinger in "Public Enemies."\n\n\n\nOnly this time he\'s just visiting -- and he\'s taking his friends out with him.\n\n\n\nIt\'s an audacious opening gambit, and when the getaway gets messy -- one of the gang panics and soon bullets are flying all over the place -- we glimpse another insight into what makes Dillinger tick. As he clings to a wounded comrade for dear life, and stares death long in the face, he has to make a decision: What to do with the guy who panicked and brought this upon them?\n\n\n\nDillinger lets him go.\n\n\n\nBased on Bryan Burrough\'s well-sourced account of the Depression-era crime wave that gave rise not only to Dillinger, but also to a whole gallery of criminal poster boys -- Machine Gun Kelly, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, the Barker gang, Bonnie and Clyde -- "Public Enemies" whittles the book down to its most dramatic duel: the nationwide manhunt for Dillinger presided over by J. Edgar Hoover (a knockout Billy Crudup) and led by his Chicago, Illinois, bureau chief, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale).\n\n\n\nDillinger and Purvis assumed folk-hero proportions in their day. According to Burrough, when newsreels showed Dillinger -- public enemy No. 1 -- he was applauded more loudly than the president.\n\n\n\nA 20th-century Jesse James, he was an underdog with a reputation for fairness. It was said he never killed anybody, and he was gallant and jocular with members of the public, once offering his overcoat to a kidnapped bank teller he had taken as a human shield.\n\n\n\nThe role is tailor-made for a self-styled rebel like Depp. He understands the outlaw\'s swagger, the ferocity that sits hand in glove with his soft-spoken sensitivity.\n\n\n\nAll the romance in the picture comes from Depp: the graceful ease with which he vaults a bank railing, his astonishing self-confidence and his dedicated courtship of hat-check girl Billie Frechette (an eager Marion Cotillard). She\'s swept up less by the high life he promises than the passionate conviction of his pitch.\n\n\n\nBurrough paints Purvis as an ineffectual, even inept agent who was fortunate to be in the right place at the right time to nab Floyd, Nelson and Dillinger. The movie has no truck with such revisionism, but betrays little interest in Bale\'s dour, narrow lawman.\n\n\n\nThe film\'s parallel cop-and-robber structure recalls Mann\'s modern classic, "Heat." Purvis and Dillinger meet only once -- to talk -- and then face off just once more, at the climax, to kill and be killed. If the confrontation of Bale and Depp doesn\'t pack the same iconic punch as "Heat\'s" Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, the (entirely fictitious) exchange in a Midwestern jail cell remains central to the film.\n\n\n\nAt one point, Dillinger reprimands Purvis for shooting down Pretty Boy Floyd, extending the poetic license still further -- as a point of historical fact Floyd died several months after Dillinger, and though Purvis was at the scene he almost certainly didn\'t pull the trigger. But Purvis did coordinate the execution of John Dillinger, an assassination as much as it was an attempted arrest, and maybe the nastiest crime in the picture. So when the incarcerated Depp advises the smug Bale that he should find a different line of work for his own peace of mind, his words carry a certain weight.\n\n\n\nStill, the movie\'s resolve to take Dillinger at face value feels a bit perfunctory, even old hat. At 140 minutes it takes a long time to find its rhythm; indeed, this is one film that would be better if it were 20 minutes longer.\n\n\n\nStill, there\'s little here that Arthur Penn didn\'t anticipate 40 years ago in "Bonnie and Clyde," except maybe the intriguing idea that organized crime pulled the plug on the old-style go-it-alone bank robber in a belated attempt to forestall Hoover\'s dream of a federal law enforcement agency. For all its loving period detail, the movie scarcely notices the desperate poverty of the times.\n\n\n\nShot largely on high definition video, "Public Enemies" doesn\'t look like the old gangster films -- it looks like TV. The images gain in immediacy what is lost in luster, but left this spectator looking for more texture, more depth -- more heat. iReport.com: Depp\'s best film?\n\n\n\nOne of the new Hollywood\'s last great stylists, Mann is well aware of the sacrifice involved in this transition. You can see it in the loving way he pictures Johnny Depp\'s doomed Dillinger watching Clark Gable\'s doomed gangster embrace his fate in "Manhattan Melodrama" while Purvis and his deputies assume their places outside Chicago\'s Biograph Theater.\n\n\n\nThere is something ritualistic about this sequence, as if Dillinger divines some measure of grace from the screen, and we congregants also play our part. The faces change, but it\'s the same old movie we remember.', 'qa': [{'question': 'Depp plays who?', 'answers': ['Johnny Depp plays the charismatic John Dillinger', 'John Dillinger']}, {'question': 'Who play the FBI man in the film?', 'answers': ['Billy Crudup)']}, {'question': 'Who does the film star?', 'answers': ['Billy Crudup)', 'Johnny Depp', '(Christian Bale).']}, {'question': 'Who stars as bank robber John Dillinger?', 'answers': ['Johnny Depp', 'Johnny', "Depp's"]}, {'question': "Whose Depp's costar?", 'answers': ['his dedicated courtship of hat-check girl Billie Frechette', '(Christian Bale).']}, {'question': 'What is a solid gangster flick?', 'answers': ['"Public Enemies,"', '"Public Enemies."']}]}
{'text': '(CNN) -- Susan Atkins, a terminally ill former Charles Manson follower convicted in the murder of actress Sharon Tate, on Tuesday was denied a compassionate release from prison.\n\n\n\nSusan Atkins, Califorina\'s longest-serving female inmate, is shown in her most recent mug shot.\n\n\n\nAtkins, 60, has been diagnosed with brain cancer and has had a leg amputated, her attorney said. In June, she requested the release, available to terminally ill inmates with less than six months to live.\n\n\n\nThe California Board of Parole Hearings\' decision -- posted Tuesday on its Web site -- came after a public hearing on Atkins\' request. It means the request will not be forwarded to the Los Angeles Superior Court that sentenced Atkins.\n\n\n\nThe court would have had the final say on Atkins\' release.\n\n\n\nHer attorney, Eric P. Lampel, called the parole board\'s decision "unfortunate."\n\n\n\n"[The board] ignored the vast majority of evidence presented," Lampel said. "There was a huge amount of pro-compassionate release testimony from many witnesses. It apparently fell on deaf ears."\n\n\n\nKnown within the Manson Family as Sadie Mae Glutz, Atkins and four others were convicted in connection with the deaths of five people, including Tate, in August 1969.\n\n\n\nAccording to historical accounts of the murder, Atkins stabbed Tate, who was eight months pregnant, and scrawled the word "pig" in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with director Roman Polanski.\n\n\n\nBy her own admission, Atkins held Tate down and rejected her pleas for mercy, stabbing the pregnant woman 16 times.\n\n\n\nAtkins\' request roused long-dormant memories of the two-day killing spree that terrorized Los Angeles and left seven people dead. It polarized those who were involved in the case -- and even those who weren\'t -- over whether she should die behind bars.\n\n\n\nAtkins told a 1993 parole board that Tate pleaded for her unborn child\'s life as she held her down.\n\n\n\n"She asked me to let her baby live," Atkins said. "... I told her I didn\'t have any mercy on her."\n\n\n\nThree of Tate\'s houseguests were also slain by the killers, as was a teenager visiting the home\'s caretaker in his cottage out back. Atkins was also convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher Gary Hinman.\n\n\n\nOne of the first people Atkins confessed to was Virginia Graham, who shared a cell with her before investigators determined the Manson Family was responsible for the murders. Graham said last month she believed Atkins should die in prison.\n\n\n\n"She showed that poor woman absolutely no mercy, none," Graham said. "So why should anybody show her mercy at this time?"\n\n\n\nSharon Tate\'s sister, Debra, has staunchly opposed Atkins\' release. "She will be set free when judged by God," Debra Tate has said. "It\'s important that she die in incarceration."\n\n\n\nLos Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley said Monday he was strongly opposed to the release, saying in a letter to the board it would be "an affront to people of this state, the California criminal justice system and the next of kin of many murder victims."\n\n\n\nCooley noted in his letter that Atkins was initially sentenced to death, like others in the Manson Family, including its leader, Charles Manson. Their sentences were commuted to life in prison in 1972, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty laws as they were written at the time.\n\n\n\nCalifornia Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Tuesday he was also opposed to releasing Atkins. "I don\'t believe in [compassionate release]," the governor told reporters. "I think that they have to stay in, they have to serve their time."\n\n\n\nEven if Atkins is dying, Schwarzenegger said, "Those kinds of crimes are just so unbelievable that I\'m not for the compassionate release."\n\n\n\nEarlier, Suzan Hubbard, director of adult prisons in California, also recommended against granting Atkins\' request.\n\n\n\nVincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted Atkins and other members of the Manson Family, said he supported her release, if only to save the state money. Through Monday, the cost for Atkins\' medical care since she was hospitalized March 18 totaled more than $1.15 million, and the costs for guarding her hospital room are more than $308,000, said California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokeswoman Terry Thornton.\n\n\n\nTerminally ill inmates rarely are allowed compassionate release, records show. In 2007, 60 such requests were made to the department, Thornton has said. Ten were approved.\n\n\n\nAtkins, who has been incarcerated since 1971, is California\'s longest-serving female inmate. According to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse, she is now a born-again Christian. During her incarceration, the site says, Atkins worked to help at-risk youth, violent crime victims and homeless children, among others. The Web site does not mention Atkins\' illness.\n\n\n\nLampel said last month Atkins is paralyzed on one side.\n\n\n\n"She can talk a little bit," Lampel said. "She can\'t sit up in bed without assistance, and obviously she can\'t walk around because she\'s an amputee."\n\n\n\nAtkins has expressed remorse for her crimes. "I know the pain I caused Mrs. Tate," she said at a parole board hearing in 1985.\n\n\n\nln May, authorities dug for buried bodies at the Inyo County, California, ranch where Manson and his followers once lived, after police became aware that testing had indicated human remains might be buried there. Nothing was found, authorities said.\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.', 'qa': [{'question': 'who was stabbed 16 times by atkins?', 'answers': ['Tate,', 'Sharon Tate,', 'pregnant woman']}, {'question': 'what happened to Atkins?', 'answers': ['was denied a compassionate release from prison.', 'denied a compassionate release from prison.']}, {'question': 'What is the condition of Mason follower?', 'answers': ['from prison.', 'Sharon Tate, on Tuesday was denied a compassionate release', 'Atkins,', 'a terminally ill former Charles Manson', 'terminally ill', 'convicted in the murder of actress', 'Susan']}, {'question': 'Atkins stabbed pregnant victim Sharon Tate 16 times', 'answers': ['down', 'held', 'stabbing', 'woman']}, {'question': 'What is the condition of Susan Atkins?', 'answers': ['terminally ill']}, {'question': 'What is she suffering from?', 'answers': ['brain cancer', 'brain cancer and has had a leg amputated,']}, {'question': 'What age is Manson follower?', 'answers': ['60,']}, {'question': 'what is the expectation of manson follower?', 'answers': ['a terminally ill former Charles', 'denied a compassionate release from prison.', 'Sharon Tate,', 'convicted in the murder of actress']}, {'question': 'Susan Atkins is bedridden, can barely speak', 'answers': ['diagnosed with brain cancer', "can't sit up in bed", 'talk a little']}, {'question': 'Who is bedridden and can barely speak?', 'answers': ['Susan Atkins,', 'Atkins']}, {'question': 'What did Atkins do to Sharon Tate?', 'answers': ['stabbing', 'murder', 'down', '16 times.', 'held']}]}
{'text': 'DOHA, Qatar (CNN) -- If there\'s anything in which Qatar takes pride -- aside from a massive construction boom -- it is providing its Qatari minority and the hundreds of thousands of expatriates working and living here with plenty of shopping opportunities.\n\n\n\nCity Center Mall booked "Freestyle Football" artist Iya Traore, from Guinea, to help draw more crowds in Doha\n\n\n\nYou can nary drive a kilometer in Doha -- few Qataris actually walk the streets -- without passing a shopping mall. And few of those malls are lacking hordes of people strolling from store to store.\n\n\n\nFrom the pricey jewel-adorned head scarf fashions to budget-conscious it-could-be-rat-leather shoes, food courts to suit Eastern and Western tastes, to perfume shops selling essences for more per ounce than many people earn in a month -- shoppers in Doha are spoiled for choice.\n\n\n\nI\'m lucky to have a few Qatari national friends in Doha. Each time I visit, I\'m treated to a familiar, and always entertaining, routine ... passing time at a succession of shopping centers.\n\n\n\nYes, many of you may think this pastime -- especially in America -- is for the kiddies. You are right. And yes, my friends and I are in our 30s. But there\'s a more sophisticated, Arab cultural aspect to "hanging out" at a Starbucks at Landmark Shopping Center or drinking mint tea at one of the restaurants in the renovated Souq Waqif. For many "shoppers" -- male and female -- these centers are an opportunity catch up with friends, and discretely flirt and mingle ... even if only by exchanging messages via Bluetooth on the cellphone.\n\n\n\nAnd unlike many teenyboppers cruising the malls of America, most of the adults here are a shop owner\'s dream: high-end, impulse purchasing consumers with a lot of money to spend -- and a lot of time to kill.\n\n\n\nLittle surprise then, that shopping mall developers and management have taken to providing more entertainment options to pull in the crowds: The obligatory movie theater, for example. One mall\'s basement is host to a skating rink. At a recent stop at City Center-Doha Mall, thumping hip-hop beats had kids dropping their McDonald\'s ice cream cones and running to the center atrium to see what all the fuss was about.\n\n\n\nTurns out there\'s this athlete literally center stage of the mall, kicking and balancing a soccer ball -- OK, football -- about his head, shoulders, legs and back with such skill he might put Ronaldo to shame -- and doing this to the beat of hip-hop African tunes for what seemed more than just a few minutes.\n\n\n\nGuinean native Iya Traore\'s "freestyle soccer" routine mesmerized the crowd. Ironically, it distracted them from shopping -- but kept shoppers in the Mall longer and gave people something new to talk about. Apparently his athletic tricks have landed him television and live performances in Japan, Turkey, Mali, Germany, France and, increasingly, in the Arab world.\n\n\n\nAfrica would seem a long way to book an act to attract more shoppers. But then again, the stakes are high in an increasingly competitive shopping mall-packed Qatar.\n\n\n\nAs long as the mall remains an outlet to spend petro-dollars -- and Doha\'s main, all-access social networking scene -- mall developers will have to step up their game to keep consumers happy.

{'text': 'WASHINGTON (CNN) -- On his final full day in office, President Bush issued commutations for two former U.S. Border Patrol agents convicted in 2006 of shooting and wounding an unarmed illegal immigrant -- suspected of drug smuggling at the time -- and then covering it up.\n\n\n\nAn artist\'s sketch shows Ignacio Ramos, left, and Jose Compean.\n\n\n\nThe prison sentences of Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean will now end March 20.\n\n\n\nRamos had received an 11-year prison sentence; Compean had received a 12-year term. They began serving their sentences in January 2007.\n\n\n\nThe Office of the Pardon Attorney was still reviewing the clemency request when Bush made his decision, Justice Department spokeswoman Laura Sweeney said.\n\n\n\n"The president has reviewed the circumstances of this case as a whole and the conditions of confinement and believes the sentences they received are too harsh and that they, and their families, have suffered enough for their crimes," a senior administration official said.\n\n\n\n"Commuting their sentences does not diminish the seriousness of their crimes. Ramos and Compean are convicted felons who violated their oaths to uphold the law and have been severely punished," the official stated.\n\n\n\n"This commutation gives them an opportunity to return to their families and communities, but both men will have to carry the burden of being convicted felons and the shame of violating their oaths for the rest of their lives."\n\n\n\nThe official noted that both Democratic and Republican members of Congress have supported a commutation, including President-elect Barack Obama\'s incoming White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, and Texas GOP Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn.\n\n\n\nThe head of the labor union representing Border Patrol agents told CNN Radio he was "grateful" that Bush commuted the sentences but questioned why the prison terms won\'t end until March 20.\n\n\n\n"I would be quite curious to learn why they have to wait another two months for an unjust sentence," said Rich Pierce, president of the National Border Patrol Council.\n\n\n\nHe said the union\'s ultimate goal would be for the men to get their Border Patrol jobs back.\n\n\n\nThe shooting happened February 17, 2005, on the border southeast of El Paso, Texas.\n\n\n\nDuring their trial, Ramos and Compean said the illegal immigrant, Osvaldo Aldrete-Davila, had brandished a gun while actively resisting arrest. Aldrete-Davila, however, said he was unarmed and was attempting to surrender when Compean attempted to beat him with a shotgun.\n\n\n\nAldrete-Davila was shot while fleeing toward the Rio Grande.\n\n\n\nRamos and Compean were ultimately convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon, lying about the incident and violating Aldrete-Davila\'s Fourth Amendment right against illegal search and seizure.\n\n\n\nAfter receiving immunity to testify in the case against the two agents, Aldrete-Davila was arrested in 2007 on charges of bringing more than 750 pounds of marijuana into the United States.\n\n\n\nThe case quickly became a political flash point, with advocates of tighter border controls defending the agents and civil liberties groups saying that the agents had used illegal and excessive force against Aldrete-Davila.\n\n\n\nBush has granted 189 pardons and 11 commutations over his eight years in office, far fewer than Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan in their two-term administrations. During the final months of the Bush administration, speculation has swirled around the question of whether former vice presidential aide Lewis "Scooter" Libby would be granted the presidential favor.\n\n\n\nLibby was convicted in March of 2007 of four counts of lying and impeding a federal investigation into the leak of information that revealed that Valerie Plame was a covert CIA operative.\n\n\n\nAmong the more notable people who have applied for -- but not received -- some form of clemency are: former Rep. Randall "Duke" Cunningham, R-California, who was convicted of receiving bribes; publishing executive Conrad Black, who was found guilty of fraud; former junk bold salesman Michael Milken, who pleaded guilty to securities fraud;  and former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers, convicted of accounting fraud.\n\n\n\nThe parents of John Walker Lindh, who was given a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty to supporting terrorists in Afghanistan, held a news conference in December urging Bush to commute their son\'s sentence.\n\n\n\nThere is a long tradition of presidents issuing pardons and commutations during their final days in office. Clinton pardoned fugitive financier Marc Rich during his last hours in office, setting off a firestorm of controversy.\n\n\n\nA commutation reduces a convict\'s prison term, but the conviction remains on the person\'s record. A pardon, however, wipes the slate clean by erasing the record of the conviction.\n\n\n\nA president has the sole authority to grant clemency to whomever he chooses, although a Justice Department office usually reviews applications and makes recommendations after considering such standards as a person\'s degree of remorse and ability to lead a responsible and productive life after release.\n\n\n\nThose applying for a pardon through the Justice Department are required to wait at least five years after their conviction or release from confinement.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What did Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean do wrong?', 'answers': ['shooting', 'assault with a dangerous weapon,', 'U.S. Border', 'then covering it up.', 'are convicted felons who violated their oaths to uphold the law', 'Patrol agents convicted in 2006', 'wounding an unarmed illegal immigrant', 'suspected of drug smuggling', 'suspected of drug smuggling at the time']}, {'question': 'What were the pair convicted of?', 'answers': ['suspected of drug smuggling at the time', 'shooting and wounding an unarmed illegal immigrant']}, {'question': 'Who received commuted sentences?', 'answers': ['U.S. Border Patrol agents', 'Jose Compean', 'U.S. Border Patrol agents convicted in 2006 of shooting and wounding an unarmed illegal immigrant', 'Ignacio Ramos', 'prison', 'of Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean will now end March 20.', 'two former']}, {'question': "Who commuted these peoples' sentences?", 'answers': ['Bush']}, {'question': 'What organization did this men previously work for?', 'answers': ['U.S. Border Patrol', 'U.S. Border Patrol agents']}, {'question': 'What does the president believe?', 'answers': ['the sentences they received are too harsh and that they, and their families, have suffered enough for their crimes," a senior administration official said.', 'the sentences they received are too harsh and that they, and their families, have suffered enough for their crimes,"', 'sentences they received are too harsh', 'has reviewed the circumstances of this case as a whole and the conditions of confinement and', 'have suffered enough for their crimes,"', '"The']}, {'question': 'What was the pair convicted of?', 'answers': ['shooting and wounding an unarmed illegal immigrant']}, {'question': 'Bush commutes whose sentence?', 'answers': ['Jose Compean', 'Ignacio Ramos', 'U.S. Border Patrol agents', 'two former']}, {'question': 'What were they convicted of?', 'answers': ['shooting and wounding an unarmed illegal immigrant']}, {'question': 'What is their release date?', 'answers': ['March 20.']}, {'question': 'Whose sentences did Bush commute?', 'answers': ['Jose Compean', 'Ignacio Ramos,', 'Ignacio Ramos', 'Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean', 'Jose Compean.']}]}
{'text': 'LONDON, England (CNN) -- The death of actress Natasha Richardson, who sustained a fatal head injury while skiing, has reignited the perennial debate around the safety of the sport.\n\n\n\n\n\nHead injuries are the most common cause of death among skiers\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 45 year-old died Wednesday, two days after falling on a beginners slope while having a private lesson at Canada\'s Mont Tremblant resort.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile full details of the circumstances surrounding Richardson\'s death are not yet known, head injuries are the most common cause of fatalities among skiers worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n"A typical death is a high speed collision with a static object after losing control -- a tree or a person," Dr Mike Langran a GP who works in Aviemore, Scotland and runs Ski-injury.com told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Most ski deaths involve multi-trauma, but a head injury is by far the most common reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There might be injuries to the abdomen or the chest or the neck but there nearly always is a head trauma as well."\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Langran, along with many other industry experts, maintains that skiing is a relatively safe sport.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I don\'t regard skiing and snowboarding as a dangerous sport," he said. "It\'s like many activities in life -- there are people who do silly things but in general these sports are safe."\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are an estimated 200 million skiers in the world, and in the U.S. (one of the few countries to keep reliable data on skiers and ski injuries) an estimated 55 million people ski.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach year there are 39 deaths, which equates to about 2 deaths per million skiers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile children and beginners are most at risk of being injured while skiing, it\'s those more experienced on the slopes who are most likely to be involved in a fatal accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n"When you look at fatalities it does tend to be younger males and often of better skiing ability who are maybe pushing limits a little bit harder, traveling a little bit faster," Langran said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Austria, earlier this year a huge debate over the safety of skiing was sparked by a high-profile incident on the slopes, which involved a German politician.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeiter Althaus, minister-president of Thuringia state was charged with manslaughter after colliding with another skier, Beata Christandl, a 41 year-old Slovakian mother of four, who later died from multiple head injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was accused by Austrian prosecutors of entering onto a slope against the direction of traffic while skiing at high speed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthaus was left with a fractured skull and has no recollection of the accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthaus\' accident may be typical of the kind that cause deaths in skiers but, The Austria Ski Federation says Althaus\' case is very unusual.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach year, an estimated 10 million people ski in Austria\'s resorts and there are between 10 and 50 deaths during this time, according to Thomas Woldrich, Head of Leisure Skiing at the federation.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There\'s a minimal risk to get hurt when skiing," Woldrich told CNN. "When you\'re skiing approximately 14 days a year, the risk of having an injury is one in 55 years."\n\n\n\n\n\nEven so, a law was recently passed in Austria making it compulsory for children to wear helmets on Austrian ski slopes.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We do have an extraordinary trend towards wearing helmets," said Woldrich. "We have, especially among children, almost 100 percent of skiers wearing helmets on Austrian ski slopes."\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether or not skiers should be forced by law to wear helmets is a debate that continues energetically in many countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe big question is do they make skiers safer.\n\n\n\n\n\nLangran says that while there is evidence to suggest that helmets will provide a moderate degree of protection for low speed impacts, there is no evidence for high speed collisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n"As far as I\'m aware there is no evidence that for high speed impacts -- you\'re talking about 30 mph plus impacts, which sounds a lot but that\'s the average speed of a good intermediate skier on the slopes -- there\'s no evidence that if you hit a tree at that kind of speed a helmet will protect you against a fatality."\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, there is evidence that wearing a helmet can give some skiers a feeling of invincibility, which can make them ski faster and more recklessly.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what can skiers do to make themselves safer?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\'s all about knowing the risks and making informed choices, according to Sean Langmuir, a trained ski instructor who has coached both the Canadian National Ski Team and the British National Ski Team.\n\n\n\n\n\n"People need to be better informed but they need to seek out that information for themselves," said Langmuir who is also Training Manager for British Association of Snowsport Instructors (BASI).\n\n\n\n\n\n"A lot of people go on ski holidays and they can\'t ski very well and they won\'t go for a lesson immediately. It can help so much to get all that basic information."\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also important to have properly fitting equipment, according to Langmuir.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It\'s not just a helmet, it can be the skis or the snowboard that you use can make a big difference to how you manage to control yourself. It\'s quite important to gain information from professionals before you go out about what equipment you will need."\n\n\n\n\n\nSkiers can also refer to the the International Ski Federation (FIS) Rules of Conduct as a guide for safety on the slopes.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The single most important piece of advice is to ski or snowboard within limits of your ability," Langran told CNN. "Don\'t go faster than you are able to and don\'t try slopes you shouldn\'t."\n\n\n\n\n\nFIS Rules of Conduct\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Respect for others  A skier or snowboarder must behave in such a way that does not endanger or prejudice others.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

If confirmed, it would be the ninth U.S. fatality associated with the flu outbreak.\n\n\n\nMemorials appeared at the door of I.S. 238 in Queens, New York, this week after the death of an administrator.\n\n\n\nThe man, who was from around Salt Lake City, was between 18 and 25 years old and "had chronic medical conditions that may have contributed to severe complications from influenza," said Gary Edwards, executive director of the Salt Lake Valley Health Department.\n\n\n\nAlso on Wednesday, health and education officials in New York announced that 21 of the city\'s public schools had been closed after an increase of reports of students with flu-like symptoms. A school administrator in Queens died after being hospitalized with the H1N1 virus, commonly called swine flu.\n\n\n\nNineteen of the schools closed at the recommendation of the Health Department are public and two are private, the city\'s Education Department announced in a news release.\n\n\n\nIn addition, two private schools in Manhattan -- St. Davis Academy and Horace Mann -- have decided on their own to close after a number of students exhibited flu-like symptoms, according the schools\' Web sites.\n\n\n\nIn the city\'s news release, city Health Commissioner Thomas R.

{'text': 'Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- A 13-year-old who witnessed another teen being set on fire last month apologized Tuesday, saying he is praying for the boy\'s recovery and he is sorry for what happened.\n\n\n\n\n\nReading to reporters from a statement, Jeremy Jarvis -- whose older brother has been charged in the incident -- said that victim Michael Brewer is in his prayers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I want to read something I wrote last night," Jarvis said. "I want to express my deepest sympathy to Mikey and his family. I will pray for Mikey to grow stronger every day and for Mikey\'s speedy recovery."\n\n\n\n\n\nBrewer, 15, remains in guarded condition at the University of Miami\'s Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center. He suffered third-degree burns over 65 percent of his body in the Deerfield Beach, Florida, incident October 12, authorities have said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice have been able to interview Brewer for the first time since the incident, the Broward County Sheriff\'s Office said. Hospital officials have said Brewer can communicate only in one- or two-word answers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The more information we have, the better position we are in to make the right decision" as far as charges and how to proceed, said Maria Schneider, a prosecutor with the state attorney\'s office in Broward County.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I would say he [Brewer] needs a little more time to be fully prepared to provide a detailed account of the incident."\n\n\n\n\n\n"It was difficult. It was difficult for him to talk about. Difficult for us to listen to," she said of the interview. "Just difficult all around, heart-wrenching. He\'s doing so much better, but it\'s such a terrible situation."\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Jarvis was arrested as a juvenile after Brewer was burned and spent about 30 days in juvenile detention. However, prosecutors have not filed charges against him. He still could be charged, as prosecutors have 90 days from his arrest to decide whether to move forward with the case.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has not been interviewed by police or prosecutors, Schneider said. "He has invoked his rights to counsel and has invoked his rights to silence."\n\n\n\n\n\nHis brother, Denver, 15, is among three teenagers charged as adults with one count of attempted second-degree murder in the attack. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I want to tell my brother D.C. I love and miss him," Jeremy Jarvis told reporters Tuesday. "I just hope and pray we all get through this."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boy\'s attorney, Stephen Melnick, would not allow reporters to ask him questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extent of Jeremy Jarvis\' involvement remains under investigation, Melnick said, adding that police took a statement from Brewer on Monday. "As far as we know, he [Jeremy Jarvis] just followed and watched what happened," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDenver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, also 15, are accused along with a third teen, Jesus Mendez, 16, of being in a group that poured alcohol over Brewer and set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle. All three pleaded not guilty in an appearance last week in Broward County Circuit Court. If convicted, they would face a sentence of up to 30 years in prison.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Denver Jarvis allegedly poured alcohol over him. Bent allegedly encouraged the attack, police said. Brewer jumped into a pool at his apartment complex to put out the flames.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities have said Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire. According to an arrest transcript, the boy said he made a "bad decision."\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Michael Brannon, a court-appointed forensic psychologist, interviewed both the Jarvis brothers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I can describe both of them as being afraid, being fearful," he told CNN earlier this month. "I can describe both of them as being tearful at various times during the interview, especially when talking about the specific incident which led to the injuries of the victim."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jarvis family met at Melnick\'s office Tuesday, shortly before the boy read the short written statement to reporters. He took no questions. During the meeting, Jeremy Jarvis played with Melnick\'s dog.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the state can still file charges against him, "it didn\'t matter to him," Melnick said. "It was important to say how this really bothers him and how much he loves his brother and how much he hopes Michael gets better."\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said Brewer is a close friend of Jeremy Jarvis, and the boy is troubled by Brewer\'s injury as well as by his brother facing criminal charges that could land him in an adult prison if convicted.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctors had planned to perform skin graft surgery on Brewer last Friday, but decided to wait and let him heal a bit more first, hospital officials said. His doctor has said he faces several more months in the hospital and will need multiple skin grafts and surgeries.\n\n\n\n\n\nMelnick would not say whether Jeremy Jarvis is cooperating with prosecutors, but said he didn\'t believe the boy\'s apology would affect whether charges are filed. "It\'s something he\'s been wanting to say from the start," he said. "He\'s been asking every day if he could say something."\n\n\n\n\n\nBroward County schools expelled the seventh-grader after his arrest, Melnick said. He is being home-schooled, and his family is exploring alternative education arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Jarvis turned 13 about a month ago, but "he understands what\'s happening," Melnick said.

{'text': "(CNN) -- Taliban advances in Pakistan are raising concerns in Islamabad and capitals as far away as Washington.\n\n\n\nCNN's senior international correspondent Nic Robertson looks at how the Taliban spread and what could be done to help Pakistan.\n\n\n\nStudents in burqas in Buner district\n\n\n\nHow is the Taliban extending its influence in Pakistan? It has extended its influence considerably over the last few years moving northwards along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, from South Waziristan to North Waziristan to Bajur and across now to Swat and Buner.\n\n\n\nBut the Taliban has also extended its influence because it is now involved with several Punjab terrorist groups that have affiliated themselves with the border Taliban and have helped commit some attacks such as one on a police station in Lahore.\n\n\n\nThe Pakistan government has been cutting deals with the different elements that were Taliban or became Taliban since 2004-2005. Those deals have enabled the Taliban to extend themselves.\n\n\n\nIs Pakistan going to fall or fail? The overall answer to that is no. But the Taliban is further destabilizing an incredibly unstable situation.\n\n\n\nThere is a weak government that faces challenges, not only from the Taliban but also from almost every political party in the country. It faces challenges from across the border with its old enemy India, which means a large percentage of the Pakistan army is tied up on that border rather than fighting terrorism.\n\n\n\nThe Taliban is not going to take Islamabad, but its attacks and advances are going to weaken an already unstable government and make an already dangerous situation even more volatile... and that will mean the Taliban will be able to wield more influence in the future than they do today.\n\n\n\nWhat options are open to the Pakistan government and other countries? Pakistan could form a broad-based government of national unity and appeal for more international support in terms of encouraging financial aid and having trade restrictions lifted so they can improve the economy.\n\n\n\nThe international community could help Pakistan resolve issues with India. It would help the economy and help the government focus on its own internal problems and better influence the situation in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nWhat the Pakistan government would also need to do is convince its people that outside support and help is in their best interests to deal with terrorism and stabilize the country.\n\n\n\nTo do that the government would also have to win the support of its large Pashtun minority, from whom the Taliban draws a lot of its support ... and that is difficult particularly as the U.S. -- which would need to be a principle supporter of Pakistan -- continues to bomb targets in Pashtun areas leading to civilian casualties.", 'qa': [{'question': 'where does taliban influence?', 'answers': ['several Punjab terrorist groups', 'in the future', 'moving northwards along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, from South Waziristan to North Waziristan to Bajur and across now to Swat and Buner.', 'the situation in Afghanistan.', 'Pakistan?']}, {'question': 'In what ways has Taliban affectedPakistan over the last few years?', 'answers': ['unstable situation.', 'involved with several Punjab terrorist groups that have affiliated themselves with the border', 'is further destabilizing an incredibly unstable situation.', 'and have helped commit some attacks such as one on a police station in Lahore.', 'been cutting', 'further destabilizing']}, {'question': 'what is the pakistani government like?', 'answers': ['weak', 'is a weak', 'unstable']}, {'question': 'What are the options for Pakistan?', 'answers': ['broad-based government', 'Pakistan could form a broad-based government of national unity and appeal for more international support in terms of encouraging financial aid and having trade restrictions lifted so they can improve the economy.', 'could form']}, {'question': 'who come up with problems?', 'answers': ['Punjab terrorist groups']}, {'question': 'What is causing the Pakistan government to be so easily weakened?', 'answers': ['attacks and advances', 'has been cutting deals with the different elements that were Taliban or became Taliban since 2004-2005.', 'The']}, {'question': 'What are some of the problems that Pakistan may face when dealing with Taliban?', 'answers': ['There is a weak government', 'its old enemy India,', 'several Punjab terrorist groups', 'army is tied up', 'challenges from across the border']}]}
{'text': 'FORT CAMPBELL, Kentucky (CNN) -- The 101st Airborne\'s senior commander in effect ordered his soldiers Wednesday not to commit suicide, a plea that came after 11 suicides since January 1, two of them in the past week.\n\n\n\nAn Army honor guard stands ready to fire a salute at Fort Campbell.\n\n\n\n"If you don\'t remember anything else I say in the next five or 10 minutes, remember this -- suicidal behavior in the 101st on Fort Campbell is bad," Brig. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend told his forces. "It\'s bad for soldiers, it\'s bad for families, bad for your units, bad for this division and our army and our country and it\'s got to stop now. Suicides on Fort Campbell have to stop now."\n\n\n\nFort Campbell\'s suicide rate, the highest in the Army, "is not a good statistic," he said in remarks to one of four divisions he addressed during the day.\n\n\n\nAfter nearly one soldier per week committed suicide at the post between January and mid-March, the Army instituted a suicide prevention program that "seemed to be having good effects" until last week, when two more suicides occurred, he said.\n\n\n\n"Suicide is a permanent solution to what is only a temporary problem," Townsend said. "Screaming Eagles don\'t quit. No matter how bad your problem seems today, trust me, it\'s not the end of the world. It will be better tomorrow. Don\'t take away your tomorrow."\n\n\n\nHe urged anyone feeling hopeless or suicidal to "tell somebody."\n\n\n\n"You wouldn\'t hesitate to seek medical attention for a physical injury or wound; don\'t hesitate to seek medical attention for a psychological injury."\n\n\n\nTownsend exhorted any soldier who suspects that a fellow soldier may be feeling suicidal to act -- first by asking how the soldier feels, then by escorting him or her to help.\n\n\n\n"Do not wait," he said.\n\n\n\nSoldiers can turn to their leaders, chaplains, medics, social workers, teammates, family and friends, he said.\n\n\n\n"Don\'t let yourself, your buddies or your families down," he said, ending his comments by repeating, "This has got to stop, soldiers. It\'s got to stop now. Have a great week."\n\n\n\nBut Townsend\'s message -- called a Second Suicide Stand-Down event -- is likely to be ineffective, said Dr. Mark Kaplan, a professor of community health at Portland State University in Oregon, who has researched veterans\' suicide and served last year on a Veterans Administration blue-ribbon panel on suicide risk.\n\n\n\n"It sounds like an order," he told CNN in a telephone interview. "I\'m not sure that a command like this is going to alter the course of somebody who is on a trajectory of self-harm."\n\n\n\nHe suggested the Army might want to adopt the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs model.\n\n\n\n"They\'re dealing with a comparable problem with a similar population," Kaplan said. "They have infused more sensitivity to their approach to suicide prevention as opposed to this. This is like any other order."\n\n\n\nThe military culture attaches a stigma to mental illness that needs to be reduced, he said. Soldiers who acknowledge they are considering suicide can suffer severe repercussions, such as losing opportunities for promotion and access to firearms, he said.\n\n\n\nIf the Army is serious about addressing the problem, it needs to address the stressors common to soldiers, including financial problems, marital problems, frequency of deployments, length of deployments, deployments to hostile environments, exposure to extreme stress and service-related injuries, he said.\n\n\n\nThe role of alcohol too must be addressed if the rate of suicide is to be lowered, he said. "More often than not, these are individuals who\'ll get liquored up, so to speak, and have access to a gun and die from a self-inflicted gunshot wound," Kaplan said.\n\n\n\nBill Lichtenstein, who serves on the board of the Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental Health Journalism, the advisory council of the Center for the Advancement of Children\'s Mental Health at Columbia University, and on the advisory board of Families for Depression Awareness, was equally unimpressed with Townsend\'s tack.\n\n\n\n"It\'s the equivalent of \'Just Say No\' to prevent drug abuse,\' " he told CNN in a telephone interview.\n\n\n\nScreening techniques that involve a series of questions are available to identify people at risk for suicide, he said.\n\n\n\n"Prominent among them, if not the most important question is: Have you made a plan for suicide? Using a simple battery of questions, you can suss out people who might be at risk, which is far more important than telling somebody, \'Don\'t take your life,\' " Lichtenstein said.\n\n\n\nThe problem is not limited to Fort Campbell. The Army has reported 64 potential active-duty suicides this year; 35 have been confirmed as suicides, and 29 are pending determination of manner of death.\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Tom Watkins contributed to this story.', 'qa': [{'question': 'How long did Brig.

{'text': '(CNN) -- President Obama should end the legal seminar on the rights of terrorists. He should instruct the lawyers at the State and Justice departments and Pentagon that the debate is over.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time has come for all to accept that terrorists cannot be treated as criminals. The main reason is that security requires preventing attacks rather than prosecuting the perpetrators after an attack. This is particularly evident when we concern ourselves with terrorists who may acquire weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also holds for terrorists who are willing to commit suicide attacks: They cannot be tried, and they pay no mind to what might be done to them after their assault. Finally, even terrorists not bent on committing suicide attacks are often "true believers" who are prepared to proceed despite whatever punishments the legal system may throw at them.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to prevention, law enforcement often springs into action after a criminal has acted: when a body is found, a bank has been robbed or a child has been kidnapped.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy and large, the criminal law approach is retrospective rather than prospective. Law enforcement assumes that punishment serves to deter future crimes -- not to eliminate them, but to keep them at a socially acceptable level. This will not do for the likes of Osama bin Laden.\n\n\n\n\n\nNor should terrorists be treated as soldiers, a dignified profession and calling. Soldiers wear uniforms that allow one to tell foes from civilians and thus prevent harming the latter when fighting the former. And the insignias that mark soldiers make it clear which governments they serve, governments that can be held accountable for their conduct -- obligations terrorists refuse to discharge. They cannot have it both ways: flout the rules of war and seek the benefits of these rules as prisoners of war.\n\n\n\n\n\nObama surely has the legal training to realize that our minds are big enough to cope with more than two categories, that terrorists are neither fish nor fowl, neither criminals nor soldiers, but a distinct species.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs such, terrorists are not without any rights. They should not be killed if they can be captured without undue risk; they should not be tortured; and their detention should be subject to, say, annual review by an institutional board -- composed of people who have security clearance, not necessarily military officers. Such a board should follow simplified procedures, as parole boards do in prisons, rather than those of civilian courts or military commissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for more on this subject from Etzioni\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrorists should not be entitled to face their accusers, or else we would divulge the sources and methods of our information-gathering about their nefarious acts. And they should not be released until we have strong reasons to hold that they are no longer a danger to us, our allies or anyone else.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration\'s position is so multifaceted that even someone who follows it closely and has considerable training cannot make out what line it is following. Some terrorists are to be tried in civilian courts -- as long as they are not in New York, or maybe only if the civilian courts are located on a military base. Or terrorists may be kept at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, or shipped to countries that do not abide by our rules or maybe only to those that do.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one can build public support and legitimacy for such a cacophony of positions and voices.

He signed off in style by scoring a thumping long-range free-kick in Sunday\'s 8-1 victory over City.\n\n\n\nRochemback, who netted seven times for Boro, played a major role in helping the club reach the 2006 UEFA Cup final, a year after appearing in the final during a loan spell with Sporting Lisbon -- where he is expected to move back to this summer.\n\n\n\nMendieta, 34, was one of football\'s costliest players when he joined Lazio from Valencia for 48 million euros in 2001, but he disappointed and joined Barcelona and then Boro on loan.\n\n\n\nThe former Spain midfielder joined permanently on a free transfer in 2004, but has not played for the first team since December 26, 2006.\n\n\n\n"It was a difficult situation for a player of Gaizka\'s caliber to find himself out of the first team reckoning," added Southgate.\n\n\n\n"I made it clear to him that he did not figure in my plans but he decided to stay and try to get back into the first team.\n\n\n\n"That didn\'t work out but his attitude to training was always excellent and he was a good influence on some of our young reserve team players."\n\n\n\nSouth Korean international Lee joined Boro on a free transfer from Pohang Steelers in January 2007. He scored only twice in 11 starts and 18 appearances as a substitute and has not appeared for the first team since early February.\n\n\n\nSouthgate is still hopeful of persuading goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer to sign a new contract at the Riverside.\n\n\n\nThe 35-year-old Australian joined Boro from Bradford City in a $3 million deal in February 1997 and has played nearly 450 games for the club.\n\n\n\nHis deal runs out this summer and he has so far refused to sign an extension, prompting reports of interest from a host of European clubs.\n\n\n\n"We are talking to Mark. I\'d like him to stay. His experience is important but he has real drive and determination that is still increasing," said Southgate.\n\n\n\n"He is the one in our dressing room that can truly say he has played at the highest level -- in World Cups, in Europe, in cup finals and so on.\n\n\n\n"We have to negotiate and see where we go, but players have to want to stay here and we have to want to keep them.\n\n\n\n"Mark has been here a long time so he has to decide if he needs a fresh challenge, whether what we are trying to do is going to excite him, whether he feels he is going to be appreciated here."\n\n\n\nSouthgate also confirmed they have offered striker Tom Craddock and right-back Tony McMahon one-year extensions to their current deals, which run out this summer.\n\n\n\nBrazilian Rivaldo has changed his mind about retiring and says he will play for Greek club AEK again next season.\n\n\n\nThe 36-year-old had decided to quit after AEK were denied the title because Olympiakos were awarded three points for a game they lost after the opposing team fielded an ineligible player.\n\n\n\n"The truth is that at the end of the championship, I felt great disappointment and a (sense of) injustice, but the love and support I have received from fans and the team have contributed to my final decision ... I have decided to stay at AEK next season," Rivaldo said in a statement on the club\'s Web site.\n\n\n\nOlympiakos lost 1-0 on February 3, but Greek sports authorities gave them the points because Apollon played Roman Wallner who had turned out for two other clubs during the season.\n\n\n\nApollon\'s appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport was rejected on April 21.\n\n\n\nOlympiakos finished the season with 70 points, two ahead of AEK, for their 11th title in 12 years.\n\n\n\nRivaldo, who has played at AC Milan and Barcelona and starred in Brazil\'s 2002 World Cup victory, spent three seasons at Olympiakos from 2004. He moved to AEK last year after a contract dispute.\n\n\n\nTottenham midfielder Jamie O\'Hara has signed a new three-year contract with the club.\n\n\n\nThe 21-year-old made his debut this season and went on to score two goals in a total 25 appearances. "He has come a long way in a short space of time so I congratulate him and this new contract is recognition of his efforts," said manager Juande Ramos.\n\n\n\n"Jamie is an example to all the young players at the club in that reaching the first team can be achieved through hard work and giving the best of yourself."\n\n\n\nHowever, Tottenham goalkeeper Radek Cerny has left the club.

"Laura and I are deeply saddened by this tragedy and continue to pray for the families of these men."\n\nLabor Secretary Elaine Chao called the ordeal "heartbreaking."\n\n"The grueling around-the-clock rescue operation that claimed three lives and injured six others has also taken a tremendous toll on the many brave rescuers and the local community, and our thoughts and prayers are with them all," Chao said in a statement.\n\nAfter drilling seven holes into mine tunnels from the mountaintop above, there has been no sign of the miners -- and microphones have picked up no sound from the men.  See a timeline of rescue efforts »\n\nTests showed underground oxygen levels were too low to sustain human life.\n\n"We basically told the families that at this point in time we\'ve run out of options," Stickler said at a news conference late Friday.\n\n"We\'ve consulted with the people that we have here, we\'ve consulted with the technical support in Pittsburgh and we\'ve consulted with private consultants in terms of where we can go," he said.\n\n"And basically, through all the information we\'ve gleaned over the past nearly four weeks in terms of the conditions we found, in terms of the air readings we found down there and ... everything else, we just don\'t know where else we can put a hole to get any other information."  See photos of the rescue mission »\n\nThere were no public statements Saturday from Bob Murray, president and CEO of Murray Mining, co-owner of the Crandall Canyon Mine, who was the outspoken face of the rescue operation for the first three weeks, then largely disappeared from public view.\n\nFederal officials became the spokesmen. No one from Murray Mining was present at Friday\'s news conference.\n\n"They are done. It\'s finished," the attorney for the families said, according to the Saturday edition of The Salt Lake Tribune.\n\n"It\'s a hard and bitter pill for our families, and there were quite a few tears shed," the newspaper quotes Colin King as saying.\n\nThe men were trapped during a collapse on August 6, and it is not known whether they survived the cave-in.\n\nEfforts to reach them were suspended 10 days later when two rescuers and a federal mining official were killed, and six people were injured in a second collapse as they tried to tunnel horizontally toward the area where the men had been working.\n\nMurray said last week that the search effort would stop if no signs of life were found at the sixth hole.\n\nUnder pressure from the families, however, he agreed to try one more time. Families wanted officials to drill a hole large enough to send down a rescue capsule.\n\nThe effort to lower the robotic device down a seventh hole had been called "a long shot" by an official.\n\nMSHA\'s Stickler said that hole was drilled into the Crandall Canyon Mine on Thursday, but there were problems with a robotic camera that teams were trying to lower into it.\n\nWork resumed Friday, this time at the fourth hole, but the camera could only descend about 7 feet, he said.\n\n"Basically, what it saw was really not that much. There was quite a bit of mud in there, water coming down the hole. It really couldn\'t go any farther than seven feet," he said of the latest try. In addition, the roof was sagging.\n\n"The families asked many, many questions and we answered them all the best we could, basically coming to the conclusion that we had run out of options."\n\nMurray said last Saturday he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the Crandall Canyon mine.\n\n"I will never come back to that evil mountain," he said.\n\nFriends and family have identified the six missing miners as Luis Hernandez, Manuel Sanchez, Kerry Allred, Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips and Don Erickson.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A series of U.S. diplomatic cables from early this year directly accused Syria of supplying advanced weaponry, including SCUD ballistic missiles, to the Shiite militia Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. protests to Damascus met with persistent denials, according to the cables, which were published by the WikiLeaks website.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a meeting in February, according to one cable, a senior U.S. diplomat stressed Washington\'s concerns directly with Syrian President Bashar Asad, "who bluntly stated that he knew of no new weapons systems going to Hezbollah."\n\n\n\n\n\nBut just a week later, an urgent note from U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the U.S. Embassy in Damascus said the United States had learned of Syrian plans to supply Hezbollah with SCUD-D ballistic missiles, which would magnify its threat to Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton wrote: "I must stress that this activity is of deep concern to my government, and we strongly caution you (Syria) against such a serious escalation." To reinforce the point, the cable continues: "Your interest in avoiding war should require you to exert maximum restraint, including restraining Hezbollah and preventing the group\'s acquisition of such lethal, long-range weapons."\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin 24 hours, the senior U.S. diplomat in Damascus met with the vice foreign minister, Faisal al-Miqdad, to convey Clinton\'s message. The cables described him as "clearly surprised" by the allegations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Flatly denying any Syrian role in the supply of weapons to Hezbollah, Miqdad contended Damascus supported Lebanese independence," a cable says, quoting Miqdad as saying: "You may hear about weapons going to Hezbollah, but they are absolutely not coming through Syria."\n\n\n\n\n\nMiqdad then went on the offensive, according to the cable, asking: "The most sophisticated weapons are coming to Israel, to be used against whom?"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the U.S. diplomat in Damascus commented: "Even a seasoned diplomat like Miqdad could not restrain a raised eyebrow at our mention of the transfer of ballistic missiles to Hezbollah."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following day another cable from the secretary of state\'s office asked U.S. diplomats to rally support from allies for Washington\'s position.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt said: "We want France, Britain, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Qatar to make a renewed push to echo our concerns with Syria." Allies should be told that Washington believed "Syria has provided or will provide guided short-range ballistic missiles to Hezbollah that could target two-thirds of Israel, including Tel Aviv, from launch sites north of the Litani." The Litani is a river in southern Lebanon.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Our information also indicates that Syria has made advanced surface-to-air missile systems available to Hezbollah and has probably provided training on these systems to Hezbollah personnel," the cable continued.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April this year, Israeli officials alleged that the transfer of SCUD-D missiles had gone ahead. At the time, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said: "If such an action has been taken, and we continue to analyze this issue, clearly it potentially puts Lebanon at significant risk."\n\n\n\n\n\nSo why would Syria provide Hezbollah with weapons that could destabilize an already volatile region? Another cable tries to answer that question. "Syrian leaders appear convinced that arming Hezbollah will increase Syria\'s leverage in bringing Israel to the negotiating table," it says.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the top U.S. diplomat in Damascus suggests in a cable that is misguided. "Syria\'s actions have created a situation in which miscalculation or provocative behavior by Hizballah could prove disastrous for Syria and the broader region," he writes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. assessment is that Hezbollah is far better-armed than it was in 2006, when it fought a one-month cross-border war against Israel. Referring to its missile and rocket armories, a cable from November 2009 says: "This capability, if fully used, would represent a quantum leap over the damage and psychological terror Hezbollah rockets caused in northern Israel during the 2006 war."\n\n\n\n\n\nRegional analysts believe that Hezbollah has some 40,000 rockets as well as up to a dozen SCUD-Ds from Syria.', 'qa': [{'question': 'Who do they accuse of supplying weaponry?', 'answers': ['Syria']}, {'question': 'What would SCUD ballistic missiles do to Hezbollah?', 'answers': ['magnify its threat to Israel.']}, {'question': 'Who is to blame for supplying ballistic missiles to Shiite militia?', 'answers': ['Syria']}, {'question': 'What was Damascus response to U.S. protests?', 'answers': ['persistent denials,']}, {'question': "What could increase Hezbollah's threat to Israel?", 'answers': ['arming', 'SCUD-D ballistic missiles,']}, {'question': 'Who did they protest to?', 'answers': ['Damascus']}, {'question': "WHat was Syria's answer to the US accusation?", 'answers': ['bluntly stated that he knew of no new weapons systems going to Hezbollah."', 'went on the offensive,']}, {'question': 'Who is accused of providing Hezbollah with SCUD ballistic missiles?', 'answers': ['diplomatic cables', 'Syria']}, {'question': 'What does SCUD stand for?', 'answers': ['ballistic missiles,']}]}

"The work they have done ... to say it is to be commended is an understatement."\n\n\n\n\n\nNot much more than 12 hours after the tornado touched down, Rohr said that between 400 to 500 firefighters, public works personnel and other municipal employees showed up Monday morning, unasked, hoping to help.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe city manager said that the turnout, and the fact many others who have pitched in in other ways, is no surprise in Joplin, a city of 50,050 residents in southwest Missouri.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Joplin is a city of neighbors helping neighbors," he said. "And with this spirit, we will overcome the hardship."\n\n\n\n\n\nYet the continually confounding weather Monday proved a major challenge. Rohr said that two first responders were struck by lightning while looking through debris -- he did not detail the victims\' conditions afterward -- with persistent thunderstorms prompting a temporary halt to the searches.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd even by Monday evening, a full day after the twister struck, Rohr said there were "gas leaks all over the city."\n\n\n\n\n\n"When we drive around, we can smell the gas," the city manager said. "And there are wires down everywhere. You have just got to be careful, as you navigate through the city."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe challenge doesn\'t appear likely to get any easier Tuesday. The National Weather Service has said there is a 45 percent chance of another tornado outbreak between 4 p.m. and midnight Tuesday over a wide swath that includes cities like Dallas, Oklahoma City and -- yet again -- Joplin.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose assisting in the rescue effort weren\'t just from Joplin. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon noted that some of the more than 1,000 first responders came from Kansas City and other locales. That doesn\'t include the 110 highway patrolmen and 250 National Guardsmen -- with another 450 on standby -- also on the scene.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Jim Roscoe told CNN that doctors, nurses and others rushed to help, after the tornado ripped through St. John\'s Regional Medical Center. Even with often impassible roads and treacherous weather, he said that, "within a matter of hours, we had almost more help than we could put to use."\n\n\n\n\n\n"I just can\'t begin to tell you," said Roscoe, who is heading the hospital\'s triage unit as it treats and redirects patients coming in for help. "We\'ve had people coming from several hundreds of miles away, grabbing their stethoscope and anything they could get, and threw it in their car and came."\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether treating patients and searching for bodies, those on the frontlines in Joplin also face a significant psychological toll of dealing with devastation that most of them have never seen before. Nixon said they would likely have "very difficult shifts, (because) there are going to see things out there that are hard to see and hard to stomach."\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, voicing a sentiment echoed by officials and residents in Joplin, the governor said it wouldn\'t prevent the first responders from heading out again, looking for survivors.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We are going to cover every foot of this town, and we\'re going to make sure that every person is accounted for," Nixon said.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What had  many of the first responders lost?', 'answers': ['own homes', 'their homes,']}, {'question': 'How many hit the streets of Joplin?', 'answers': ['250 National Guardsmen', '110 highway patrolmen', 'more than 1,000']}, {'question': 'Are they still looking for suvivors?', 'answers': ['survivors.']}, {'question': 'Who said many of these first responders had lost their own homes', 'answers': ['Mark Rohr', 'Richard Serino, deputy administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency,', 'city manager Mark Rohr']}, {'question': 'Who came from far away', 'answers': ['Kansas City and other locales.', '1,000 first responders']}, {'question': 'Where did doctors help?', 'answers': ["St. John's Regional Medical Center.", 'Joplin, Missouri,']}]}
{'text': '(CNN) -- She added smart to sexy as a Bond girl opposite Pierce Brosnan\'s 007, and proved her dramatic and action credentials in "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon," but for actress Michelle Yeoh, life and acting are both all about balance.\n\n\n\nMichelle Yeoh: "There are reasons why you do movies. It\'s for the love of it."\n\n\n\n"I think it\'s very boring for my audience, just to see me in the regular roles. I love my action films. And I think right now, I have a nice balance," she told CNN\'s Talk Asia.\n\n\n\nPoise and balance are something that Yeoh is naturally blessed with. Her childhood dream of becoming a professional ballerina was dashed when she sustained an injury while training at the Royal Academy of Dance in London.\n\n\n\nHowever, she continued to study completing a degree in dance and a minor in drama, before serving as Miss Malaysia at the age of 21, which was more of an ambassadorial role for the country\'s tourism industry than bikini modeling.\n\n\n\nMaking her film debut in an action movie in 1984, she made further appearances in Hong Kong action films doing her own stunts, until she married millionaire Hong Kong businessman Dickson Poon in 1988 and put her career on hold.\n\n\n\nOn giving up acting for the sake of her married life she said: "At that time, it\'s very difficult to try and juggle a normal life, be where your husband is, try to start a family life, and filming months on end in another country. So I weighed my options. I am a person that believes, you have to give your all. There\'s no half measure in doing things. You do it well or at least you\'ve got to give it your best shot."\n\n\n\nThe couple divorced three years later and Yeoh resumed her film career in 1992 in the Jackie Chan smash-hit "Police Story 3."\n\n\n\nWhile she continued to use her athleticism in her roles and do her own stunts, in the pursuit of playing good characters and that all-important balance, she credits the directors she has chosen to work with.\n\n\n\n"I look at the scripts and you can understand where the story is going ... but it\'s a director with a vision that brings it to life," she said.\n\n\n\n"There are reasons why you do movies. It\'s for the love of it or you\'re thinking of your paycheck. And you have to find your own balance."\n\n\n\nWhen it came to doing "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," Ang Lee was the essential ingredient.\n\n\n\n"I did it really because I adore Ang Lee. That\'s a true film maker, where they move you, they bring you to places where you can\'t imagine but want to be."\n\n\n\nBut being an all-or-nothing person has taken its toll when it has come to the stunts she has performed.\n\n\n\nYeoh tore her anterior cruciate ligament after the first sequence she performed for "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," which meant that only the dramatic scenes in the film could be shot until she had recovered.\n\n\n\nYeoh has turned her attention to producing as well as acting and found it a challenging experience.\n\n\n\n"As an actor you would be judged on how your performance is and so that\'s where your focus is. It\'s a very selfish environment and that sense, because as you know, you can\'t make excuses afterwards. But as a producer, you have to make sure everyone is well protected and everyone is safe. And if anything goes wrong, it\'s all on your shoulders," she told CNN.\n\n\n\nThe films she produced, 2002\'s "The Touch" and "Sliver Hawk" from 2004 were panned by critics, but she makes no excuses: "That\'s the nature of the business. You should never take these things personally when it works or doesn\'t work."\n\n\n\nAnd when it comes to passing on what she\'s learned to young Asian actors, her advice is typically practical.\n\n\n\n"For any Asian face, or any Asian girls that have dreams, aspirations or doing crossover work in Hollywood, you must have the language.

{'text': 'Washington (CNN) -- House Republican leaders will unveil a 21-page "Pledge to America" on Thursday that presents a "governing agenda" for what Republicans would do if they win control of Congress in November.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN obtained a copy of the document (PDF) Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan focuses primarily on jobs and the economy, with a short reference in the "preamble" to the party\'s position on social issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the document, House Republicans want to permanently extend all the tax cuts due to expire at the end of this year, give small businesses a tax deduction equal to 20 percent of their income and require Congress to review any new federal regulations that add to the deficit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe document lacks, however, a pledge against unrelated pet projects that members of Congress insert in spending bills to bring funding to their home districts -- known as earmarks. Banning earmarks is typically a staple of Republican policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome provisions matched positions of the conservative Tea Party movement that has helped defeat mainstream Republican candidates in several primary elections this year. For example, the document calls for a federal hiring freeze on nonsecurity employees and requiring all legislation to include a clause showing that it is authorized under the Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther items would cancel unspent funding authorized by the economic stimulus bill, roll back spending to levels before the stimulus bill and earlier federal bailout legislation and repeal the health care reform bill passed in March.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe document also calls for permanently prohibiting taxpayer funding for abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral Republican sources said there was no intention to directly address social issues because the electorate is so heavily focused on jobs and spending.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican leaders settled on a line that states: "We pledge to honor families, traditional marriage, life, and the private and faith-based organizations that form the core of our American values."\n\n\n\n\n\nThis language was a late addition, according to a GOP source, after conservative Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana argued that social issues should be included in the document representing the agenda of House Republicans.\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Democratic leaders said the document showed that Republicans want to return to what they called failed policies of the past. A statement from House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer\'s office mocked the GOP positions, saying they showed that Republicans pledged allegiance to hedge fund managers on Wall Street, insurance companies, the "wealthiest of the wealthy," oil companies and big corporations that outsource jobs, "with a recession and huge deficits for all."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GOP document represents an updated version of the 1994 "Contract with America." That much shorter, 10-item document, with specific bills attached to each item that would be passed with a Republican victory, was rolled out on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and signed by GOP members of Congress and candidates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2010 version has more than 20 items, including changes to how Congress works and broad policy goals such as tougher sanctions against Iran. While it does contain legislative proposals, it does not include specific bills that would be introduced and passed if Republicans gain control of the House.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduced at roughly the same time as the previous contract, several weeks before midterm congressional elections, the "Pledge to America" will be unveiled at a hardware store in Sterling, Virginia, outside Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\nA GOP lawmaker involved in putting together the document said House Republicans realize that voters are angry with both Democrats and Republicans. The agenda contained in the "Pledge to America" is intended to convince such voters that their concerns are taken seriously by Republicans, who will act differently if returned to power than they did when controlling Congress during parts of the Bush administration, the legislator said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Tom Cohen contributed to this story.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What have Democrats called this?', 'answers': ['failed policies of the past.']}, {'question': 'Is "Pledge" different from "Contract with America"?', 'answers': ['has more than 20 items,']}, {'question': 'What supports has been blocked?', 'answers': ['cancel unspent funding authorized by the economic stimulus bill,']}, {'question': 'where is ban on federal funding for abortion?', 'answers': ['America."']}, {'question': 'What do Democrats call the GOP positions?', 'answers': ['failed policies', 'they showed that Republicans pledged allegiance to hedge fund managers on Wall Street, insurance companies, the "wealthiest of the wealthy," oil companies and big corporations that outsource jobs,']}]}

While the big tour buses clog the neighboring Ring of Kerry before heading east to kiss the Blarney Stone, in Dingle it still feels like the fish and the farm actually matter.\n\n\n\nFishing boats still sail from Dingle, and a nostalgic whiff of peat scents its nighttime air, offering visitors an escape into pure Ireland. For 30 years my Irish dreams have been set here, on this sparse but lush peninsula where locals are fond of saying, "The next parish is Boston."\n\n\n\nOf the peninsula\'s 10,000 residents, 1,500 live in Dingle Town. Its few streets, lined with ramshackle but gaily painted shops and pubs, run up from a rain-stung harbor, home to a friendly dolphin. You\'ll see teenagers -- already working on ruddy beer-glow cheeks -- roll kegs up the streets and into the pubs in preparation for another night of music and craic (fun conversation and atmosphere).\n\n\n\nThe Dingle Peninsula is worth exploring by bike or car. It\'s 10 miles wide and runs 40 miles from Tralee to Slea Head. The top of its mountainous spine is Mount Brandon, at 3,130 feet, the second-tallest mountain in Ireland. While only tiny villages lie west of Dingle Town, the peninsula is home to 500,000 sheep. The weather on this distant tip of Ireland is often misty, foggy, and rainy. But don\'t complain -- as locals will explain, there is no bad weather ... only inappropriate clothing.\n\n\n\nLeaving Dingle Town by car or bike, it becomes clear that the peninsula is an open-air museum. It\'s littered with monuments reminding visitors that the town has been the choice of Bronze Age settlers, Dark Age monks, English landlords, and Hollywood directors ("Ryan\'s Daughter," and "Far and Away"). The Milestone B&B decorates its front yard not with a pink flamingo, but with an ancient pillar stone -- one of more than 2,000 stony pieces in the puzzle of prehistoric life here.\n\n\n\nNear the red, two-room schoolhouse, a street sign warns Taisteal go Mall -- Slow Down. Near the playground, students hide out in circular remains of a late Stone Age ring fort. In 500 B.C. it was a petty Celtic chieftain\'s headquarters, a stone-and-earth stockade filled with little stone houses. Many of these ring forts survived the centuries because of superstitious beliefs that they were "fairy forts."\n\n\n\nThe wet sod of Dingle is soaked with medieval history. In the darkest depths of the Dark Ages, when literate life almost died in Europe, peace-loving, bookwormish monks fled the chaos of barbarian raids on the continent. They sailed to this drizzly fringe of the known world and lived their monastic lives in lonely stone igloos or "beehive huts," which you\'ll see dotting the landscape.\n\n\n\nSeveral groups of these mysterious huts, called clochans, line the road. Built without mortar by seventh-century monks, these huts take you back. Climb into one. You\'re all alone, surrounded by dank mist and the realization that it was these monks who kept literacy alive in Europe. To give you an idea of their importance, Charlemagne, who ruled much of Europe in the year 800, imported Irish monks to be his scribes.\n\n\n\nRounding Slea Head, the point in Europe closest to America, the rugged coastline offers smashing views of deadly black-rock cliffs and the distant Blasket Islands. The crashing surf races in like white horses, while longhaired sheep graze peacefully on the green hillside.\n\n\n\nStudy the highest fields, untouched since the planting of 1845, when the potatoes never matured and rotted in the ground.\n\n\n\nThe great famine of that year, through starvation or emigration, nearly halved Ireland\'s population. Because its endearing people have endured so much, Ireland is called "The Terrible Beauty."\n\n\n\nTake your time at the Gallaras Oratory, circa A.D. 800, the sightseeing highlight of your peninsula tour. One of Ireland\'s best-preserved early Christian churches, its shape is reminiscent of an upturned boat. Its watertight dry-stone walls have sheltered travelers and pilgrims for 1,200 years.\n\n\n\nFrom the Oratory, continue up the rugged one-lane road to the crest of the hill and then coast back to Dingle Town -- hungry, thirsty, and ready for a pint.\n\n\n\nRick Steves writes European travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio.

{'text': '(CNN)  -- Judging by the hysterical reaction in some quarters, to President Obama\'s handshake with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, or his bow to Saudi Arabia\'s King Abdullah, you would think that America\'s national security rested solely on body language not sound policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe presidential handshake between Barack Obama and Hugo Chavez spurred many comments.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut just for the record, let\'s not forget that President George W. Bush kissed and held hands with the same Abdullah after 9/11, while also looking deep into the soul of Vladimir Putin. And a generation earlier, egged on by British Prime Minister "Iron Lady" Margaret Thatcher, President "Tear Down That Wall" Ronald Reagan, decided that indeed Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was a man he could do business with: the business of ending the Cold War.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Obama has not managed in 100 days to defeat Islamic militants, usher in a Middle East peace treaty or disarm North Korea, on these and other issues he has laid down some important groundwork. Most importantly, the global polls following his first overseas trip show he has begun restoring America\'s name and reputation, key ingredients to successful policy making.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven before stepping onto foreign soil, Obama began by ordering the infamous Guantanamo Bay detention center closed, thus returning the United States to upholding the very same rule of law it preaches to other nations. He also has  stated over and over again that "America does not torture," thus returning the United States to leading on human rights, not cherry-picking them.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo those such as former Vice President Dick Cheney who claims this will make America more vulnerable, even some former Bush administration officials now concede that rigorous but patient above-board interrogation has proven to yield better, more reliable intelligence than a rush to the waterboard.\n\n\n\n\n\nObama has kept a campaign pledge and given a fixed date for ending the unpopular U.S. war in Iraq. "Let me say this as plainly as I can: By August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end," he announced.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet the perils are clear. Hundreds of Iraqi civilians have been killed in Baghdad and other cities in a surge of sectarian violence since January. The Obama administration and U.S. military leaders are playing it down, blaming the suicide bombings on a few militant cells. That brings back memories of Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld blaming a "handful of dead-enders" as the original insurgency was getting into full swing. Much work still needs to be done to stabilize Iraq militarily and politically.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing down in Iraq means surging in Afghanistan, which along with Pakistan is still viewed as the central front on terror. "If the Afghanistan government falls to the Taliban or allows al-Qaeda to go unchallenged," Obama said in March, "that country will again be a base for terrorists."\n\n\n\n\n\nSo he has ordered 21,000 new U.S. troops there by summer. But for all the talk of more boots on the ground, negotiating with moderate Taliban and beefing up Afghan security forces, danger will persist unless the Afghan people see more of a peace dividend. As Obama himself recognizes, "There will be no lasting peace unless we expand spheres of opportunity for the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan."  Watch highlights from Obama\'s first 100 days »\n\n\n\n\n\nDire poverty still stalks the land and people desperate to feed their families will lay an IED for cash if they cannot farm or find a decent paying job. Although the Taliban had less than 8 percent support in Afghanistan at the end of 2007, according to an ABC poll, Afghan public opinion is turning against the U.S.-led coalition partly because of the rising number of civilian casualties as the U.S. military hunts down terrorists with airstrikes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same is happening in Pakistan. When unmanned drones and other airstrikes target militants but cost many civilian lives, it turns people against the United States. One month ago, President Obama unveiled an Afghan-Pakistan strategy for stabilizing the region, and yet things have gotten so much worse in the weeks since that now he, British officials and other world leaders openly fear the Talibanization of nuclear-armed Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nA furious Pakistan government accuses the United States of sowing panic among the people and insists it\'s in full control of its country and its nuclear arsenal. But it is hard to overdramatize the danger as this U.S. ally concedes land and appeases the Taliban, then watches as it reneges on a so-called "peace deal" and rolls ever closer to the capital, Islamabad. On May 6 and 7, Obama will be meeting in Washington with the presidents of Pakistan and Afghanistan. In the fight to deny the militants a tipping point momentum, the military tells me 2009 will be crucial.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for Iran, which even two years ago candidate Obama said would be directly engaged by his administration, there is nothing formal yet between the two sides.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter 30 years of enmity, President Obama offered Iran "the promise of a new beginning" in a Persian New Year video message, and since then has clearly signaled the United States was over regime-change. The Iranian government and leadership have responded in kind, saying they are ready to engage with America if the administration is really committed to changing its Iran policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, much of this good will has been over the airwaves and direct or back-channel talks have yet to start. Into this vacuum are stepping all the sundry pro- and anti-Iran interest groups, experts, analysts and nations, with their often-conflicting advice and sometimes confused understanding. Yet it is widely acknowledged that a strategic realignment with Iran would benefit U.S. and regional security and stability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new Israeli government wants to see no such thing, and wants people to believe it will bomb Iran\'s nuclear facilities, a belief it fosters with background briefings to journalists in the United States and presumably elsewhere. In an ironic twist, Israel\'s Arab neighbors are bringing their dire warnings about Iran to the White House.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeantime, Obama has named a new Middle East Peace envoy, former Sen. George Mitchell, signaling he wants to take negotiations out of the deep freeze and committing to the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians. Trouble is new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not signed on to the two-state solution and is trying to fend off this pressure, even suggesting Israel won\'t engage with the Palestinians until the United States takes care of Iran.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, Obama told Jordan\'s King Hussein at the White House, "My hope would be that over the next several months you start seeing gestures of good faith on all sides." He added, "We can\'t talk forever; at some point, steps have to be taken so that people can see progress on the ground." The president has invited the leaders of Israel, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority to the White House in coming weeks. iReport.com: Grade Obama\'s first 100 days\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second hundred days in foreign policy will be filled with mini-summits at the White House and major summits abroad -- Russia in July and China sometime later.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith all this activity, Obama is clearly shifting the United States away from the "isolate and punish" policy of his predecessor. He is signaling that clearheaded meetings to discuss issues of mutual concern are better than hiding your head in the sand and hoping they\'ll go away.

{'text': 'PADUCAH, Kentucky (CNN) -- He arrives in the early morning hours, when the downtown streets here are empty and quiet.\n\n\n\nFormer U.S. soldier Steven Green has been convicted of raping and killing a 14-year-old Iraqi girl.\n\n\n\nAn electric gate jerks to life as the black sedan with tinted windows pulls into a parking lot protected by an iron fence. It\'s five blocks from the local county jail to the U.S. Federal Courthouse of Western Kentucky. Not even a five-minute drive.\n\n\n\nThis is the only freedom Steven Green knows.\n\n\n\nHe\'s ushered from the car by a contingent of U.S. marshals. It\'s 30 feet out in the open air. A brief chance to look up at the clouds. A moment to hear sounds not reverberated against cell walls: a bird, a car engine, a breeze in nearby trees.\n\n\n\nHe is a lanky 24-year-old. He looks lean, like he could grow a little more. Not really a man, but too old to be called a boy.\n\n\n\nRegardless, he is a convicted murderer, rapist, and conspirator.\n\n\n\nThe orange prison coveralls make him look a bit taller. The jury never sees Green in the fluorescent jumpsuit. Inside the federal courthouse there is a change of clothes. Usually it\'s a button-down shirt and a pair of khakis. He keeps his cuffs buttoned.\n\n\n\nHe looks nerdish, and you half expect him to start working on the courtroom computers. Not like a man who once asked FBI agents if they thought he was "a monster."\n\n\n\nEvidence comes in a steady display of pictures and videos that seem oddly connected. The snapshot of a smiling woman lying in a field of bluebonnets. The image of a dead Iraqi strapped to the hood of an Army Humvee. A high school yearbook photo of a Texas football team. The diagram of a brain cell. Video of a firefight shot from an insurgent perspective.\n\n\n\nThe most unusual trial exhibit sits against the wall behind the prosecutor\'s table: a small architectural mock-up of a home. Roughly 18 by 18 inches, it is like no home in Kentucky. A flat-topped square with a raised rectangular structure at the top providing access to the roof. It is beige in color. The tiny windows have tiny bars. It is a 3-D map of a crime scene.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, a jury found Green guilty of a raping a 14-year-old girl who lived in the home in Iraq, then killing her and setting her body on fire to destroy evidence. Green also was found guilty of killing the girl\'s parents and 6-year-old sister.\n\n\n\nThere is a casual manner to Steven Green\'s daily entrance into the courtroom. It defies the circumstances of the moment and the imagination without proper context. This is the sentencing phase of his death penalty trial and he is the defendant.\n\n\n\nTestimony resumes Monday, with the expectation of closing arguments as early as Wednesday. Green faces life in prison without the possibility of parole, or death in prison.\n\n\n\nThe testimony transports the court to unusual places: across Texas following Green\'s dysfunctional childhood, into the sense of structure and order of Army basic training at Fort Benning, Georgia, and back to the chaos of horrendous combat situations four years ago in Iraq\'s Triangle of Death.\n\n\n\nGreen is a former member of the 101st Airborne Division, inserted into a very bad section of Iraq during some of the worst fighting of the war. His memories are of a place known as Yusufiya, 20 miles south of Baghdad. Jurors form a mental picture of his life then as former members of his unit, Bravo Company, take the stand.\n\n\n\nAmid the military lingo, the witnesses pause occasionally, struggling to convey the contempt, confusion, exhaustion, and death they knew. They speak of being shot, of killings, booby traps and sudden bloody dismemberments.\n\n\n\nThis toxic emotional mix is what former Pfc. Green knew in 2005 and 2006 almost every day, along with the very real possibility of his own death. If the jury opts for its most extreme option -- the death penalty -- unlike his daily death watch in Iraq, at least Green will see that coming.\n\n\n\nWhen a friend or family member enters the courtroom, Green tries to make anxious eye contact. He whispers a lot to his attorneys. His hands stay around his face and his gaze on the table when the victims\' family speak through an interpreter.\n\n\n\nThe Al-Janabis\' relatives do not speak of details of the crime. The questions come only from the prosecution, and the defense does not cross-examine. They speak of an orchard worker, Kassem, and his wife, Fakhriya. They speak of a simple family who did not own either their home or the furniture. They speak of a funny 6-year-old girl, Hadeel, being chased through the orchard trees by siblings. They speak of a 14-year-old girl, Abeer, with dreams of living in the city and wearing nice clothes.\n\n\n\nThe jury never hears the words "rape" or "murder" come from the translation. It is a testimony about loss. The defendant sits rigid the entire time.\n\n\n\nThe mention of other names comes frequently in court. Spc. James Barker: The jury knows him as the soldier who concocted a plan over a card game to target the Al-Janabi family -- a mission of gang-rape and murder. Sgt. Paul Cortez: The defense counsel describes him as senior non-commissioned officer, the one who approved the mission as long as he was the first to rape Abeer. Pfc. Jesse Spielman: His name is familiar as the fourth member of the squad to leave their traffic checkpoint on March 12, 2006, after donning disguises, and enter the Al-Janabi home. Pfc. Bryan Howard is the soldier left behind to guard their post.\n\n\n\nEach is out of the Army, sentenced to prison time by a military court for his part in the crime and the failed coverup. Green, the trigger man, is the odd man out. He sits before the jury, convicted in civil court for this war atrocity. His early release from the Army two months after the crime is a possible death sentence, while three of his accomplices face the possibility of parole from an Army prison in 2016.\n\n\n\nGreen still sports a military haircut. Seated at the table alongside his defense team, he often leans over and speaks with Darren Wolff, a former Marine Corps captain turned Kentucky defense lawyer. There are letters on file in the court docket from Wolff petitioning Defense Secretary Robert Gates to re-enlist Green in the Army, so the former private could face trial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. It is not unheard of in this war.\n\n\n\nWolff points out in conversation that the Pentagon re-activated two former Marines after word surfaced of an alleged murder in Falluja in 2004. He says Green should face a jury of his military peers. The fact that has not happened, and the former Army private sits in the U.S. District Court of Western Kentucky tried under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act for crimes committed in Iraq, may be a point of appeal.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, Green exits the courtroom, climbs back into his prison garb and is shackled. There\'s another short walk to the car, then a five-block return drive to take in the world. He returns to solitary confinement.

{'text': "(CNN) -- It's not as achingly hip as Barcelona and it's more manageable than Madrid: Spain's third city has plenty of flavor, an urban edge and uniquely Valencian oddities.\n\n\n\nFrom medieval cathedrals to Calatrava's futuristic City of Arts and Sciences, Valancia packs in plenty.\n\n\n\nWhere else could you glimpse the Holy Grail in the morning, gorge on paella on a Mediterranean beach for lunch and then wander along a old river bed transformed into a park and visit architectural blockbusters that look like a Star Trek vision of a colonized planet?\n\n\n\nAfter an early morning shot of coffee and, depending on your sugar tolerance, churros, the Cathedral in the heart of the old city is the best place to start the day. Located on the Plaza de la Reina, the cathedral is an impressive mix of gothic, baroque and Romanesque architectural styles.\n\n\n\nAs striking as the many parts of the cathedral are, the sight of the Holy Grail my leave you underwhelmed -- to the unenlightened it resembles something closer to a plastic mug circa. 1973.\n\n\n\nIf you're in town on a Thursday, catch the enactment of a tradition almost as old as the grail. The Tribunal de las Aguas, or Water Court, is the meeting of the city's elders, who gather outside the cathedral's Plaza del Palau for around twenty minutes. It generally involves a number of old men sitting down not doing very much, while one pronounces what has been decided, and it's a bit of a tour-group hot spot.\n\n\n\nOn the other side of the plaza is the octagonal Miguelte Bell Tower, where you can climb 207 steps for a panoramic view of the low-rise old city. Not far through the old city's happy tangle of narrow streets is the Lonja: a fifteenth-century trading house, studded with a fine collection of mugging gargoyles now preserved under UNESCO Heritage status.\n\n\n\nBringing yourself out of the city's medieval landmarks, you can feast on modern culture at IVAM, the city's cheap and excellent modern art gallery.\n\n\n\nBut for a vision of the future as designed by local superstar architect Santiago Calatrava, wander along the city's old river bed towards The City of Arts and Sciences. It's made up of four gleaming white architectural confections, including the Palau de Les Arts Reina Sofia concert hall, which is covered in cracked white tiles that glisten in the sunlight.\n\n\n\nA few minutes away is the final piece of the architectural dreamscape, the Oceanografico -- one of the world's biggest aquariums. With two shark tunnels, beluga whales, walruses and thousands of fish it should sate anyone looking for a glimpse of the life aquatic.\n\n\n\nThe Mediterranean Sea itself is not far away, and public transport in Valencia is a convenient way to get around town when things get out of comfortable walking distance. To get to the beach from the center of town hop on a tram on line 5 from Colon towards Neptu.\n\n\n\nWhen there you'll find a beachside strip of hotels and paella restaurants offering versions of the city's most famous culinary dish. The area was scrubbed up when Valencia hosted the Americas Cup, sailing's blue riband event, in 2007. Beyond the rice and seafood delights and the anodyne redeveloped area by the docks, the beach bar of Hotel Neptuno offers some choice classy cocktails. To be extra chilled, snag one of the massage therapists walking along the promenade for a bargain 10 euro beach massage or reflexology session.\n\n\n\nBack in town, the covered market of the Mercado Central is a must, not just for foodies, but for people-watching. The beautiful modernista building was constructed in 1928 -- look out for the green parrot weathervane.\n\n\n\nEating and drinking in the city is a rich experience. Tapas is ubiquitous, but make sure you try horchata -- a sweet local specialty made from a mix of water, sugar and ground tigernut. Among the city's numerous specialist bars serving the cooling drink, the Horchataria de Santa Catalina provides some fine mixes in a traditional tiled interior.\n\n\n\nFor late night drinks the bars and cafes around Barrio del Carmen are popular with locals and visitors -- San Jaume, housed in an opulent old pharmacy, is a prime spot for people watching at any time of day or night and a little further away, Café Lisboa is buzzy and friendly on the Plaza Dr Collado.\n\n\n\nSummers in the city are blistering, with mid-autumn and spring the best seasons to visit. But it's every March that Valencians exhibit the Spanish love for a street party during the Las Fallas festival.\n\n\n\nIts origins are a bit murky, harking back to pagan rituals, but today it's a noise fest, with daily processions and ear-splitting fireworks set off through the city's streets, even during the daytime. The biggest daily barrages take place in the Plaza del Ayuntamiento -- the city's main square. Out of season some of the effigies and floats built during previous festivals can be seen year round at the Museum of Las Fallas on Plaza Monteolivete.\n\n\n\nCNN's Linnie Rawlinson contributed to this report", 'qa': [{'question': "who's third city?", 'answers': ['Valancia', "Spain's"]}, {'question': 'Which is the third largest city in Spain?', 'answers': ['Valancia', 'this']}, {'question': 'what was transformed into a park?', 'answers': ['old river bed', 'a old river bed', 'Mediterranean beach']}, {'question': "Which is Spain's third largest city?", 'answers': ['Valancia']}, {'question': 'As it is referred to as the third largest city in Spain?', 'answers': ['Madrid:']}, {'question': "who's architectural masterpiece is it?", 'answers': ['and Romanesque', 'Ayuntamiento', 'tolerance,', 'Valancia', 'blockbusters', 'Plaza']}]}
{'text': "(CNN) -- A United Nations court convicted a former governor of Rwanda to life in prison for his role in a 1994 genocide that left about 800,000 dead in the central African country.\n\n\n\nAn estimated 800,000 people -- mainly Tutsis -- were killed in Rwanda in 1994.\n\n\n\nTharcisse Renzaho was found guilty of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\n\n\nThe verdict, delivered Tuesday, is the third judgment on charges of genocide delivered this year by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). The U.N. court is holding hearings in Arusha, Tanzania, where it is based.\n\n\n\nRenzaho was governor of the capital, Kigali, and a colonel in the Rwandan Armed Forces in 1994 during the country's genocide, when extremist militias made up of ethnic Hutus slaughtered ethnic Tutsis across Rwanda.\n\n\n\nIt began in April of that year and within 100 days, an estimated 800,000 people were killed.\n\n\n\nThe court found that Renzaho ordered soldiers, police and militias to set up roadblocks to identify Tutsi civilians to be executed. It found he ordered the distribution of weapons to people who then killed Tutsis.\n\n\n\nRenzaho also supervised a selection process at a refugee site where about 40 Tutsis were abducted and killed, the court found.\n\n\n\nRenzaho participated in an attack at the Sainte Famille church in which more than 100 Tutsis were killed. People across Rwanda sought refuge in churches all over the country as the genocide unfolded.\n\n\n\nHe also made remarks encouraging the sexual abuse of women, according to the court, and was found criminally liable for the rapes that followed.\n\n\n\nThe genocide ended when Tutsi-led militias backing Rwandan President Paul Kagame ousted the Hutu government supporting the massacre.\n\n\n\nRenzaho was arrested in September 2002 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. His trial began in January 2007 and closed in September that year after hearing from 53 witnesses, including Renzaho.\n\n\n\nThroughout the trial, Renzaho maintained his innocence and said he had no association with the militia. Renzaho's lawyer blamed the case on political interference by the Rwandan government.\n\n\n\nRenzaho has the right to appeal the verdict.\n\n\n\nThe decision is the third judgment on charges of genocide delivered this year by the tribunal.\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Rukundo, a former military chaplain, was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity and sentenced to 25 years in prison. The court found Rukundo had a history of contempt for Tutsis and his fellow clergymen, and that he ordered the killings of Tutsi civilians.\n\n\n\nCallixte Kalimanzira was sentenced to 30 years in prison for genocide and incitement to commit genocide. The court found that Kalimanzira, a senior civil servant who at one point worked with the Interior Ministry, participated in various massacres of Tutsi civilians and actively encouraged other crimes against them.\n\n\n\nProsecutors at his trial said he beat some Tutsis to death and called for the elimination of all Tutsis, including pregnant women and their babies.", 'qa': [{'question': 'What did he order?', 'answers': ['genocide', 'incitement to commit genocide.', 'Tutsi civilians to be executed.', 'soldiers, police and militias to set up roadblocks to identify', 'distribution of weapons to people who then killed Tutsis.']}, {'question': 'What was his job at the time?', 'answers': ['colonel in the Rwandan Armed Forces', 'governor']}, {'question': 'Who was governor of Kigali in 1994?', 'answers': ['Tharcisse Renzaho', 'Renzaho']}, {'question': 'What is Renzaho guilty of?', 'answers': ['genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.', 'of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.']}, {'question': 'Who is making genocide judgments?', 'answers': ['governor of Rwanda', 'United Nations court', 'the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).']}, {'question': 'When did this happen', 'answers': ['1994']}, {'question': 'What is he guilty of?', 'answers': ['genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.', '1994 genocide that left about 800,000 dead in the central African country.']}, {'question': 'How many years did this go on', 'answers': ['100 days,']}]}
{'text': '(CNN) -- A woman convicted in the 2002 kidnapping of Utah teenager Elizabeth Smart pleaded guilty in the attempted kidnapping of Smart\'s cousin a month later, court officials said Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn exchange for Wanda Barzee\'s plea of guilty but mentally ill to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping, prosecutors dropped state charges against her in Smart\'s abduction, said Nancy Volmer, spokeswoman for Utah state courts.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarzee, 64, pleaded guilty in November to federal charges of kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor in connection with Smart\'s abduction. As part of that plea agreement, she agreed to cooperate with the state and federal cases against her husband, Brian David Mitchell, federal prosecutors have said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarzee and Mitchell were accused of abducting Smart, then 14, at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family\'s Salt Lake City home in June 2002. Smart was found nine months later, walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy, Utah, in the company of Barzee and Mitchell, a drifter and self-described prophet who calls himself Emmanuel and had done some handyman work at the Smarts\' home.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe month after Smart was kidnapped, prosecutors alleged, Barzee and Mitchell attempted to break into the home of her cousin, but were unsuccessful. The girl was 15 years old at the time, according to CNN affiliate KSL. She is not named in court documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Mr. Mitchell\'s attempt was thwarted when the minor child awakened, which caused Mr. Mitchell to flee," the court documents said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing her arrest in 2003, Barzee told authorities that she and Mitchell went to the home in order to abduct the girl, and planned to hold her, along with Smart, in the couple\'s camp in the mountains, according to court documents.\n\n\n\n\n\nSentencing is set for May 21 on the state charge, Volmer said. Barzee faces between one and 15 years in prison, but prosecutors have agreed to allow that sentence to run concurrently with her federal sentence, according to court documents.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal prosecutors have recommended a sentence of 15 years in prison for her in exchange for her cooperation against Mitchell. Federal sentencing was set for May 19, but a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors has said a sentence would not be imposed until Barzee\'s cooperation against Mitchell is complete.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the hearing in federal court, Barzee apologized to Smart, according to a transcript.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I\'m greatly humbled as I realize how much Elizabeth Smart has been victimized and the role I played in it," she said. "I\'m so sorry, Elizabeth, for all the pain and suffering I have caused you and your family. It is my hope that you will be able to find it in your heart to forgive me one day."\n\n\n\n\n\nBarzee had been housed at the Utah State Hospital while courts determined her competency as well as Mitchell\'s. After years of being declared incompetent, she recently was declared competent to stand trial, according to the Salt Lake Tribune newspaper. A state court had ruled she could be forcibly medicated, and that ruling led federal prosecutors to proceed with bringing a case against the couple, the Tribune said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a competency hearing for Mitchell in October, Smart, now 21, testified that she had been held captive in Utah and California. Just after her abduction, Mitchell took her to a wooded area behind her home and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her, she said. During the nine months of her captivity, Smart testified, no 24-hour period passed without her being raped by Mitchell.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge Dale Kimball has not yet ruled on Mitchell\'s competency.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A mining company has found what may be the largest gold deposit ever found in the British Isles, the company\'s chairman said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe price of gold is at historic highs, making new prospects very valuable.\n\n\n\nDrill samples indicate more than 1 million ounces of gold may lie below what is now rolling Irish countryside, said Richard Conroy, the chairman of Dublin, Ireland-based Conroy Diamonds and Gold.\n\n\n\nWith the price of gold near historic highs, the find could be worth as much as $300 million on the market, Conroy told CNN.\n\n\n\nThe company has been working for 10 years to find gold in a 1,500-square kilometer (600-square-mile) area spanning the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, he said. The site where the company found the gold is near Clontibret, a village in the northern part of Ireland, he said.\n\n\n\n"I think it\'s a major development in Ireland that we now have a significant gold resource," Conroy said. "It\'s the largest amount of gold, the largest number of ounces, that\'s ever been reported in Ireland, or indeed in either Britain or Ireland."\n\n\n\nThe price of gold is currently around $900 an ounce on global commodities markets. Factoring in costs for mine construction and operation, Conroy said, the gold near Clontibret could fetch roughly $300 million.\n\n\n\nThe company now plans to do more drilling at the site and conduct feasibility studies before moving ahead, he said.\n\n\n\nAn analyst cautioned, however, that the reported amount of gold is still only an estimate.\n\n\n\n"Until you\'ve actually mined the stuff, there\'s always a moderate level of uncertainty," said William Tankard, a senior analyst at metals consultancy GFMS in London.\n\n\n\nOne million ounces, if confirmed, would be significant for both Conroy and Ireland, Tankard said. Ireland has small precious metal deposits but nothing as large as Conroy\'s reported find, Tankard said.\n\n\n\nConroy said only one gold mine is currently active in Ireland.\n\n\n\n"By no means is it world-leading, but a million ounces is certainly worth thinking about," Tankard said.\n\n\n\nTankard added that the quality of the gold -- including grade and how concentrated it is -- will also affect its value.', 'qa': [{'question': 'Where might more than 1 million ounces of gold lie?', 'answers': ['below what is now rolling Irish countryside,', 'rolling Irish countryside,', 'Irish countryside,']}, {'question': 'More than how many ounces of gold may lie below the countryside?', 'answers': ['1 million']}, {'question': 'What would be the worth?', 'answers': ['as much as $300 million', '$300 million', 'as much as $300 million on the market,']}, {'question': 'what is the quantity of gold expected', 'answers': ['more than 1 million ounces of gold may lie below what is now rolling Irish countryside,', 'One million ounces,']}, {'question': 'It may be the largest gold deposit found where?', 'answers': ['in the British Isles,', 'British Isles,']}, {'question': 'what will it be worth', 'answers': ['as much as $300 million', '$300 million']}, {'question': 'what did company find?', 'answers': ['British Isles,', 'in', 'the largest gold deposit ever found', 'may be the largest gold deposit ever found in the British Isles,', 'may be', 'largest gold deposit']}, {'question': 'What metal was found?', 'answers': ['gold', 'largest gold deposit']}, {'question': 'What could the find be worth?', 'answers': ['as much as $300 million', '$300 million']}, {'question': 'what is the worth of gold?', 'answers': ['$300 million', '$900 an ounce']}, {'question': 'what did the company find', 'answers': ['largest gold deposit ever found in', 'may be the largest gold deposit ever found in the British Isles,', 'may be', 'British Isles,']}, {'question': 'what is found below Irish countryside?', 'answers': ['gold deposit', 'more than 1 million ounces of gold', '1 million ounces of gold']}]}
{'text': 'Editor\'s Note: Donna Brazile, a Democratic strategist, is chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee\'s Voting Rights Institute and founder of Brazile & Associates, a political consulting firm. She was the campaign manager for the Al Gore-Joe Lieberman ticket in 2000 and wrote "Cooking with Grease."\n\n\n\nDonna Brazile says Barack Obama\'s inauguration is a huge milestone in the fight for equal rights\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- Today Barack Obama will be sworn in as the 44th president of the United States of America.\n\n\n\nThis is the day for which so many prayed, so many marched and so many more sacrificed.\n\n\n\nThis is a day of jubilation and celebration.\n\n\n\nThis is the day to rejoice and recommit ourselves to restoring the American dream for us all.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama\'s election offers our country the opportunity to open a new chapter that will allow us to turn the corner on past prejudices and racial politics.\n\n\n\nWhen Sen. Obama announced his candidacy for president in 2007, most people, black and white, thought it would be, at best, an interesting sideshow.\n\n\n\nAfter Obama\'s victories in the early primaries, there came the controversial videos of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, broadcasting a racial divisiveness that cast even greater doubt on an Obama candidacy. But the senator moved quickly to reassure people that Wright\'s jaundiced view of America did not reflect his own.\n\n\n\nAmericans wanted to move beyond racial categorization and the politics of division. Obama understood that. And so did the voters. But African-Americans didn\'t believe it.\n\n\n\nSeventy-one percent of black voters had never thought a black candidate for president would get elected in their lifetime, according to a national poll released in November by CNN/Opinion Research Corp. Yet 59 percent of white respondents said they had thought it was possible.\n\n\n\nObama did not just win the caucuses in Iowa  -- a state with a white population of more than 94 percent -- he resoundingly captured it. Other primary victories, once thought improbable, soon followed.\n\n\n\nThese included Georgia, and Virginia, the former seat of the Confederacy.\n\n\n\nOn Election Day, Obama won a higher percentage of the white vote than John Kerry did in 2004, though he did not get a majority of whites.\n\n\n\nUnlike other black presidential candidates before him, Obama did not run as "the black candidate." He ran as a Democratic candidate, a U.S. senator from Illinois, and a progressive. And America, by larger margins than in previous recent elections, voted for the progressive Democratic U.S. senator from Illinois who happened to be biracial.\n\n\n\nFor too long, race has been the stain on the American fabric. As Secretary Condoleezza Rice reminded us, race has been our "nation\'s birth defect." At times during the long primary and general election, race became a subtle distraction -- but the American people rejected it and it was never the primary issue.\n\n\n\nNor was it the primary issue for Americans who voted for Barack Obama. The vast majority of those who voted for and against Obama did so based on the content of his political prescriptions and platform -- not the color of his skin.\n\n\n\nA lot of lessons were taught November 4. Obama\'s election revealed the possibility of three new truths for African-Americans: White America may not be as racist as African-Americans thought they were; a solution to our country\'s lingering racial problem may eventually be found; and the Rev. Martin Luther King\'s dream that one day all people will be judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin is alive and within reach.\n\n\n\nObama\'s election has inspired 6 in 10 blacks to forecast better race relations in the United States. "A majority of blacks now believe that a solution to the country\'s racial problems will eventually be found," said CNN polling director Keating Holland.\n\n\n\n"In every previous poll on this topic dating back to 1993, black respondents had always said that racial problems were a permanent part of the American landscape. Even in the most recent polls taken last week, a majority of African-Americans said that a solution to the country\'s racial problems could be within reach; now blacks and whites agree that racial tensions may end."\n\n\n\nYes, of course, racism still exists in America. But if a black man can become president of the United States of America, then aren\'t all Americans now free to believe they can achieve any goal they set for themselves?\n\n\n\nSo on this day, let us all rejoice and be glad. Let us celebrate this moment in American history and let us resolve to find common ground. Let us resolve to join together as a nation to ensure that racial prejudice in America, as well as an ethic of non-achievement based on excuses and low expectations, dies the same death it did in the November ballot box.\n\n\n\nWhat our founders envisioned -- what President Lincoln and the Rev. King fought and died for, we are perhaps finally ready to achieve. This is a remarkable moment. Though not the apex we need to reach, it is still a mountaintop, alive with possibilities, a dream no longer deferred.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What did Brazile say hardly anyone did two years ago?', 'answers': ["Barack Obama's inauguration is a huge milestone in the fight for equal rights"]}, {'question': 'Obama ran as a what?', 'answers': ['a Democratic candidate,', 'He', 'Democratic candidate,', 'a progressive.', 'as a Democratic candidate,', 'U.S. senator from Illinois,']}, {'question': "What is Obama's inauguration a time for according to Brazile?", 'answers': ['This is a day of jubilation and celebration.', 'is a huge milestone in the fight', 'equal rights']}, {'question': 'What did Lincoln fight for?', 'answers': ['racial prejudice in America, as well as an ethic of non-achievement based on excuses and low expectations, dies the same death it', 'equal rights', 'in the November']}, {'question': 'What did Donna Brazile say?', 'answers': ["Barack Obama's inauguration is a huge milestone in the fight for equal rights"]}, {'question': 'Who took Obama seriously?', 'answers': ['Americans', 'Donna Brazile', 'voted for Barack', 'a Brazile']}, {'question': 'What did Brazile say Obama ran as?', 'answers': ['as a Democratic candidate, a U.S. senator from Illinois, and a progressive.', 'huge milestone in the fight for equal rights', 'Democratic candidate,']}, {'question': "What didn't Obama run as in the election?", 'answers': ['did not', '"the black candidate."']}, {'question': "What did Donna Brazile say about Obama's inauguration?", 'answers': ['is a huge milestone in the fight for equal rights']}]}

{'text': 'LONDON, England (CNN) -- Ailing "Great Train Robber" Ronnie Biggs -- one of the most notorious British criminals of the 20th century -- was formally released from prison to his death bed Friday after being granted his freedom on compassionate grounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nRonnie Biggs, pictured at a book launch in Rio de Janeiro in 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggs, who is gravely ill with severe pneumonia, is being cared for at a hospital in Norwich, eastern England, where he was moved on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree prison staff who had been assigned to Biggs\' bedside have been withdrawn following UK Justice Minister Jack Straw\'s decision to authorize his release, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The medical evidence clearly shows that Mr Biggs is very ill and that his condition has deteriorated recently, culminating in his re-admission to hospital," Straw said in a statement Thursday. "His condition is not expected to improve."\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggs\' son, Michael Biggs, said his father was "over the moon" that he had been released on the eve of his 80th birthday. Speaking to reporters outside the hospital, he confirmed his father had been handed his release papers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"As a family, we are absolutely thrilled," Michael Biggs said, according to the UK\'s Press Association.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggs is unable to walk, barely able to communicate and no longer able to eat or drink, Michael Biggs said, adding that the family was "very hopeful that my father will be able to survive the next few days."\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggs\' legal advisor Giovanni Di Stefano told journalists that Biggs was unlikely to ever leave his hospital bed. "This man is ill, he\'s going to die... he is going to stay in hospital," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday also marks the 46th anniversary of the infamous 1963 heist dubbed the "crime of the century" that transformed Biggs from a petty London thief into one of the most wanted men in Britain.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggs and 14 other professional criminals made off with more than £2.5 million ($4.2 million) in used bank notes -- the equivalent of around £40 million ($67 million) today -- after holding up a mail train from Glasgow to London in the early hours of the morning. In the course of the robbery the train driver was badly beaten with an iron bar.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the gang, including Biggs, were soon picked up in a massive manhunt after police discovered fingerprints at a farmhouse hideout where the robbers had holed up to split their spoils.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggs was sentenced to 30 years in prison but escaped over the wall of a London prison after serving just 15 months -- and spent most of the rest of his life as a celebrity fugitive.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter undergoing extensive plastic surgery in Paris, Biggs made his way to Australia, living there with his wife and two children. Tracked down by police, Biggs fled again in 1969, this time to Brazil.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive years later, Biggs was traced once more by a newspaper reporter. Metropolitan Police Detective Superintendent Jack Slipper, who had led police efforts to bring the train robbers to justice, flew out to Rio de Janeiro to arrest Biggs, allegedly greeting him at a beachside hotel: "Long time no see, Ronnie."\n\n\n\n\n\nBut efforts to bring Biggs home were frustrated because by then he had fathered a Brazilian-born son -- Michael Biggs -- and authorities rejected British requests for his extradition.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggs continued to live openly in Rio, trading on his notoriety by entertaining tourists, selling t-shirts and even recording with the Sex Pistols.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1981 he was kidnapped by a gang of British ex-soldiers and smuggled to Barbados.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama each accused the other of borrowing portions of their presidential campaign speeches Monday.\n\n\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, left,  on the stump with Sen. Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nThe Clinton campaign accused Obama of borrowing from a close supporter, and the Illinois senator responded by saying his own words have been used by Clinton.\n\n\n\nOn a conference call with reporters, Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said it was clear Obama had "lifted rhetoric" from Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick.\n\n\n\nLate Monday, Clinton followed up with a swipe of her own.\n\n\n\n"If your whole candidacy is about words, then they should be your own words," Clinton said in Madison, Wisconsin. "That\'s what I think."\n\n\n\nObama downplayed the significance of the accusation.\n\n\n\n"I\'ve written two books, wrote most of my speeches. So I think putting aside the question ... in terms of whether my words are my own, I think that would be carrying it too far," Obama said.\n\n\n\n"Deval and I do trade ideas all the time, and you know he\'s occasionally used lines of mine," Obama said.\n\n\n\nObama said he also used some of Deval\'s words at a Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Wisconsin.\n\n\n\n"I would add I\'ve noticed on occasion Sen. Clinton has used words of mine as well," said Obama. "As I said before, I really don\'t think this is too big of a deal."\n\n\n\nObama campaign officials said Clinton had a pattern of borrowing from some of her rival\'s signature phrases, including "Yes, We Can" and "Fired Up, Ready to Go." They circulated a YouTube video and list of these alleged instances to reporters.\n\n\n\nThe Clinton campaign earlier pointed to similarities between the words of Obama and Patrick that have raised eyebrows and attracted traffic on YouTube.\n\n\n\nA central passage in a speech Obama gave Saturday -- aimed at convincing voters that his campaign is not just about lofty rhetoric -- is adapted from one that Patrick used in his 2006 campaign, the Obama campaign said when asked about it.\n\n\n\nThe controversy is lost on the Massachusetts governor, who endorsed Obama.\n\n\n\nObama\'s campaign had Patrick call the New York Times over the weekend and issue a statement.\n\n\n\n"Senator Obama and I are long-time friends and allies. We often share ideas about politics, policy and language," Patrick said in the statement. "The argument in question, on the value of words in the public square, is one about which he and I have spoken frequently before. Given the recent attacks from Senator Clinton, I applaud him responding in just the way he did."  Watch a comparison of Obama\'s and Patrick\'s speeches »\n\n\n\nThe Obama campaign also confirmed comments chief strategist David Axelrod -- an adviser on Obama\'s Senate campaign and Patrick\'s gubernatorial run -- made to the New York Times about the speeches.\n\n\n\n"They often riff off one another. They share a world view," Axelrod told the Times about Obama and Patrick. "Both of them are effective speakers whose words tend to get requoted and arguments tend to be embraced widely."\n\n\n\nResponding to attacks from Clinton that he offers words while she offers action, Obama has been arguing that words matter.\n\n\n\nSaturday night at a gala for the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Obama said to frequent applause, "Don\'t tell me words don\'t matter! \'I have a dream.\' Just words. \'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\' Just words. \'We have nothing to fear but fear itself.\' Just words, just speeches!"\n\n\n\nIn 2006, Patrick, fending off attacks from his rival Kerry Healey, told a crowd, "Her dismissive point, and I hear it a lot from her staff, is all I have to offer is words. Just words. \'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal\' -- just words. Just words. \'We have nothing to fear but fear itself\' -- just words. \'Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country\' -- just words. \'I have a dream\' -- just words."\n\n\n\nClinton has argued that while Obama provides rousing speeches, she has the stronger grasp of the issues and the knowledge of how to use the presidency to start making changes from "day one."\n\n\n\nSpeaking last week at a General Motors plant in Ohio, she said, "There\'s a big difference between us -- speeches versus solutions, talk versus action.

{'text': '(CNN)  -- From a small apartment in Toronto, Iranian exile Saeed Valadbaygi is trying to bring news from his country to the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a network of Iranian journalists and eager volunteers back in Tehran, the 27-year-old former student collates reports, pictures and video for his Web site astreetjournalist.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving fled Iran following the June demonstrations, Valadbaygi set up the site in November -- his latest attempt to beat what he says are government hackers and offer news and views about the unrest in Iran.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith international media operating under restrictions in Iran, independent journalists using blogs and social networking sites have become an important source of information.\n\n\n\n\n\n"What\'s happening in Iran is not being reflected globally. We want to let the world know and let the state know that the world is watching," said Valadbaygi.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the deadly street demonstrations in Tehran on December 27, Valadbaygi said his web site had 17 million hits in two days. The site, which is maintained by about 12 volunteers, wobbled and slowed down, but stayed up and running.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We\'ve already experienced a large number of viewers on our blogs and web sites and therefore we have been hacked by the regime of Iran repeatedly and unfortunately have lost access to many of our web sites. But introducing this web site (to) professional colleagues and also lots of viewers who are currently collaborating with us has helped in achieving wonderful results in the past few days."\n\n\n\n\n\nValadbaygi believes in the power of social media. He is active on Facebook and Twitter and maintains a blog called Revolutionary Road.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Facebook and Twitter have turned into a strong tool for people in spreading news. Citizen journalists have the most effect on news and today we clearly see that each citizen in Iran is acting as a media. Therefore we have the responsibility in gathering the news in one place to achieve a better result against the regime\'s censorship," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nValadbaygi, who says he was expelled in 2008 from Amirkabir University in Tehran because of his political views, took part in the June protests and distributed underground newspapers as an independent demonstrator, rather than a supporter of opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeciding that he needed to leave Iran to pursue his politics, he says he went first to Turkey before arriving in Canada as a "political refugee" and quickly connecting with an ex-pat Iranian community in Toronto. He now works long hours collating information for his web site.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Valadbaygi worries about his parents, brother and sister in Tehran. He says his brother was recently arrested. He communicates with his family using multiple email accounts while his parents use public phones to minimize the risk of the call being traced.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he acknowledges that his network of correspondents in Iran, which he says is spreading to cities beyond Tehran, contact him in the full knowledge that they could attract the attention of the authorities. "They could track the IP addresses and this could cause problems in the workplace or university."\n\n\n\n\n\nValadbaygi says eight of the people he has worked with in the past are currently in jail.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing the latest street demonstrations, Valadbaygi says the protest movement is fragmented with diverse demands but there is a groundswell of public opinion that wants a new secular government.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It\'s important that a leadership emerges as quickly as possible otherwise it might all die down."', 'qa': [{'question': 'Saeed Valadbaygi left Iran after taking part in protests in which month?', 'answers': ['June']}, {'question': 'When did Saeed Valadbaygi leave Iran?', 'answers': ['following the June demonstrations,', 'June']}, {'question': 'How many million hits did he have?', 'answers': ['17']}, {'question': 'Who takes risks in contacting him?', 'answers': ['parents', 'his parents']}, {'question': 'who took a risks in contacting him', 'answers': ['his parents', 'Valadbaygi']}, {'question': "Exile's network is getting news out of Iran and to where?", 'answers': ['the world.']}, {'question': 'who is saeed valadbaygi', 'answers': ['Iranian exile']}, {'question': 'What is getting news out of Iran and onto the internet?', 'answers': ['Saeed Valadbaygi']}]}

{'text': 'London, England (CNN) -- Something is stirring within the Hamas body politic, a moderating trend that, if nourished and engaged, could transform Palestinian politics and the Arab-Israeli peace process. There are unmistakable signs that the religiously based radical movement has subtly changed its uncompromising posture on Israel.\n\n\n\nFor example, in the last few months top Hamas officials have publicly stressed that they want to be part of the solution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, not part of the problem. What is happening inside Hamas\' mosques and social base shows a concerted effort on the part of its leadership to re-educate its rank and file about co-existence with the Jewish state and in so doing mentally prepare them for a permanent settlement in the future.\n\n\n\nIn Gazan mosques, pro-Hamas clerics have begun to cite the example of Salah al-Din al-Ayubi, a famed Muslim military commander and statesman, who, after liberating Jerusalem from the Western Crusaders, allowed them to retain a coastal state of their own. The moral lesson of the story is that if the famed leader could tolerate the warring, bloodthirsty Crusaders, then today\'s Palestinians should be willing to live peacefully with a Jewish state in their midst.\n\n\n\nThis story is important because it provides Hamas with religious legitimacy and allows it to justify and explain its change of direction to followers. As an Islamic-based movement, Hamas\' very raison d\'etre rests on religious legitimization, and its leaders understand that they neglect that at their peril.\n\n\n\nHamas\' recent narrative marks a pronounced departure from the past in which Hamas moderates called for a minor or long-term truce.\n\n\n\nNow Hamas leaders appear to be going further by laying the ground for a shift in their position by educating their social base about the requirements of permanent peace -- recognition of the Jewish state. Although the evolution of Hamas\' stance on the peace process has been slow, gradual and qualified, in the last three years many of its leaders repeatedly have said they wanted a two-state solution.\n\n\n\nPressed by an Australian journalist on policy changes that Hamas might make to any new order, Khaled Meshaal, the top Hamas leader and head of its political bureau based in Syria and considered a hard-liner, asserted that the organization has already shifted on several key points: "Hamas already changed -- we accepted the national accords for a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders, and we took part in the 2006 Palestinian elections."\n\n\n\nOver the years, I have interviewed more than a dozen Hamas leaders inside and outside the Palestinian territories. Although, on the whole, Hamas\' public rhetoric calls for the liberation of all historic Palestine, not only the territories occupied in 1967, a healthier debate occurs within.\n\n\n\nMy recent conversations with Hamas\' rank and file suggest that the militant organization has evolved considerably since the group unexpectedly won power in Gaza in free elections in 2006. Before then, Hamas was known for its suicide bombers, not its bureaucrats. But that had to change.\n\n\n\n"It is much more difficult to run a government than to oppose and resist Israeli occupation," a senior Hamas leader told me while on official business in Egypt in 2007. "If we do not provide the goods to our people, they\'ll disown us." Ironically, in spite of the West\'s refusal to regard this government as legitimate, the democratic demands for governance from within Gaza are themselves driving change within Hamas.\n\n\n\nWhat is striking about Hamas\' recent shift of opinion toward the peace process is that it has come at a trying time for the Islamist organization which, in the last two years, has faced critical challenges from al Qaeda-like jihadist groups, a low-intensity civil war with rival Fatah, the ruling party of the Palestinian Authority, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n\n\n\nLast summer a militant group called Jund Ansar Allah, or the Warriors of God, one of a handful of radical al Qaeda-inspired factions, declared the establishment of an Islamic caliphate in Gaza, a flagrant rejection of Hamas\' authority. Hamas security forces struck instantly and mercilessly at the Warriors, killing more than 20 members, including the group\'s leader, Abdel-Latif Moussa.\n\n\n\nIn one stroke, the Hamas leadership sent a message to its foes and friends that it will not tolerate the existence of global jihadist groups such as al Qaeda: Hamas will not allow al Qaeda-inspired factions to turn Gaza into a theater to wage transnational jihad.\n\n\n\nHowever, the challenge to Hamas\' authority persists. Israel\'s punishing siege of Gaza, in place since 2007, along with the suffering and despair it has caused to its 1.4 million inhabitants, has driven hundreds of young Palestinians into the arms of small Salafist extremist factions that accuse Hamas of forfeiting the armed struggle and failing to implement Quranic or Shariah law.\n\n\n\nOperationally and ideologically, there are huge differences between Hamas and al Qaeda and its various inspired factions, and a lot of bad blood. Hamas is a broad-based religious/nationalist resistance whose focus and violence is limited to Palestine/Israel, while al Qaeda is a small, transnational terrorist group that has carried out attacks worldwide.\n\n\n\nThus Hamas, unlike al Qaeda and other fringe factions, is not merely an armed militia but a viable social movement with a large popular base that has been estimated at more than half a million supporters and sympathizers. Hamas also has shown itself to be sensitive and responsive to Palestinian public opinion.\n\n\n\nA further example of its political and social priorities is Hamas\' decision to engage seriously with an Egyptian-brokered deal that sketches out a path to peace with rival Fatah.\n\n\n\nDespite its reactionary rhetoric, Hamas is a rational actor, a conclusion reached by former Mossad chief Ephraim Halevy, who also was Ariel Sharon\'s national security adviser and who is certainly not an Israeli peacenik.\n\n\n\nThe Hamas leadership has undergone a transformation "right under our very noses" by recognizing that "its ideological goal is not attainable and will not be in the foreseeable future," Halevy wrote in Yedioth Ahronoth a few months ago. His verdict is that Hamas is now ready and willing to accept the establishment of a Palestinian state within the temporary borders of 1967.\n\n\n\nYet if Hamas is so eager to accept a two-state solution, why doesn\'t it simply announce that it recognizes Israel\'s existence and promise to negotiate a peace deal that allows the two countries to coexist?\n\n\n\nIn interviews with Hamas officials, they stress that their organization has made significant concessions to the so-called Quartet\'s three conditions, though the Quartet (the United Nations, Russia, United States and European Union) has not lifted the punishing sanctions against Hamas nor has it effectively pressed Israel. Hamas\' diplomatic starting point will be to demand that Israel recognizes the nationalist rights of the Palestinians and withdraws from the occupied territories, but it will not be its final position.\n\n\n\nThere could be no viable, lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians if Hamas is not consulted about peacemaking and if the Palestinians remain divided with two warring authorities in the West Bank and in Gaza.\n\n\n\nHamas has the means and public support to undermine any agreement that does not address the legitimate rights and claims of the Palestinian people. Its rival, Fatah and the Palestinian Authority, lacks a popular mandate and the legitimacy needed to implement a resolution of the conflict. President Mahmoud Abbas has been politically weakened by a series of blunders of his own making and by pressure by the U.S., compromising his moral authority in the eyes of a sizable Palestinian constituency.\n\n\n\nIf, instead of ignoring Hamas or, worse yet, seeking its overthrow, the United States and Europe engaged the Islamically based organization, diplomatically and politically, and encouraged it to continue moderating its views, the West could test the extent of Hamas\' evolution and find out if the organization is willing to accept a settlement based on the two-state solution.\n\n\n\nSo far, the strategy of isolating and militarily confronting Hamas pursued by Israel and the Bush administration has not appeared to weaken the organization dramatically. If anything, what success this strategy has had in undermining Hamas has been counterproductive, since it has radicalized hundreds of young Palestinians who have joined extremist al Qaeda-inspired factions and reinforced the culture of martyrdom and nihilism.\n\n\n\nTo break this impasse, and prevent further gains by more extremist factions, the U.S. and Europe should support a unified Palestinian government that could negotiate peace with Israel. The ongoing Egyptian-brokered truce deal between Hamas and Fatah is an opportunity that may be built on to repair and strengthen intra-Palestinian governing institutions that have been frayed as a result of intense rivalry in the last two years.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fawaz A.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A racially-charged word with many meanings may be at the root of a dispute between two sports rivals that reaches far beyond the soccer field, analysts say.\n\n\n\n\n\nManchester United\'s Patrice Evra, who is black, says the word Uruguayan Luis Suarez shouted repeatedly during a match last month was a racial slur. Evra demanded that Suarez be held accountable for the controversial exchange, which erupted as authorities investigate other accusations of racism in soccer.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuarez, a striker for Liverpool, hasn\'t specified what he said, but he argues that it wasn\'t offensive.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I didn\'t insult him. It was only a form of expressing myself. I called him something his own teammates from Manchester call him," Suarez said, according to the Uruguayan newspaper El Pais.\n\n\n\n\n\nBritish media reports have suggested Suarez used the Spanish word "negrito."\n\n\n\n\n\nIf that\'s the case, whether Suarez\'s remark was racist is a complicated question that doesn\'t have a black-and-white answer, according to scholars who\'ve studied race issues in Latin America.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading figures call on soccer chief to step down\n\n\n\n\n\n"It\'s about questions of translation or context," said Mark Sawyer, director of the Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Politics at the University of California Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe word\'s literal translation is "little black man." But generally, negrito is not considered a racial slur in Latin America, Sawyer said. In fact, it frequently has a positive meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It\'s often a term of endearment," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what the word means also depends on where -- and how -- it\'s said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"In Puerto Rico, it has one meaning. In Cuba it has a slightly different connotation and in the Dominican Republic it has a slightly different connotation," said Jorge Chinea, director of the Center for Chicano-Boricua Studies at Wayne State University in Detroit.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlatter a controversial figure\n\n\n\n\n\nChinea said his mother and stepfather, both of whom were light-skinned, frequently used the word.\n\n\n\n\n\n"When they talked as a couple, my mother would say, \'negrito, I love you.\' ... I grew up listening to those expressions commonly being used by a lot of people in my community in Puerto Rico. And it was never associated with any color," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter he moved to the United States in the 1960s, Chinea said, the word took on a different meaning. Many of his acquaintances used racial nicknames, he said, but there was no harm intended.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It was always more like a quick way of acknowledging the distinctiveness of that person in a very friendly way," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Chinea said one of his Cuban colleagues in graduate school who employed the word drew criticism.\n\n\n\n\n\n"When he used it and other people heard it, people came to me to complain. ... In the United States, it sounds offensive to some people," Chinea said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Uruguay, the meaning is clear, said U.S. radio talk show host Fernando Espuelas, who originally hails from the South American country.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It\'s not a slur whatsoever," said Espuelas, whose show often addresses racism in the Latino community. "It\'s a term of endearment. You definitely would not use that if you were angry. It would sound ridiculous."\n\n\n\n\n\nBlatter comments spark Twitter storm\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral scholars said the word\'s meaning could be connected with complicated racial politics in different Latin American countries, which each had unique historical experiences with colonization and the slave trade.\n\n\n\n\n\nUruguay, Chinea noted, has a smaller population of African descendants than some other Latin American nations. In 2006, about 9% of the population declared "Afro or black" roots, according to Uruguay\'s National Statistics Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\n"If I were of African descent and someone from that part of the world was to use the word toward me, I would probably think twice about what the intentions are, whereas if the person who was saying it was from Cuba you\'d probably take it as a joke. And if you said it to a Puerto Rican, they\'d just love it," Chinea said.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the word negrito to describe U.S. President Barack Obama got a Honduran government official into hot water in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen-Foreign Minister Enrique Ortez was forced to resign after he called Obama a "negrito who does not know where (the Honduran capital of) Tegucigalpa is."\n\n\n\n\n\nBut analysts said without hearing exactly what Suarez shouted in the October football match, or how he said it, it\'s impossible to know what he meant.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It\'s a very interesting case. It will be interesting to see if the English Football Association actually consults experts on this," Sawyer said. "If you want to charge someone with racism or making a racial slur, the person should at least have the intent of making a slur. It\'s not necessarily clear that Luis Suarez had that intent."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe association said Wednesday that it was charging Suarez, but did not provide details about what transpired.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It is alleged that Suarez used abusive and/or insulting words and/or behavior towards Manchester United\'s Patrice Evra contrary to FA rules," the association said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n"It is further alleged that this included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or color and/or race of Patrice Evra," the statement said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool said in a statement that the club expects Suarez to request a personal hearing on the issue and "remains determined to clear his name of the allegation made against him by Patrice Evra."\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a post on his Facebook page shortly after the October match, Suarez said the accusations of racism upset him.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I can only say that I have always respected and respect everybody," he said. "We are all the same. I go to the field with the maximum (enthusiasm) of a little child who enjoys what he does, not to create conflicts."\n\n\n\n\n\nEvra, in an interview with France\'s Canal Plus, said evidence would support his claim.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There are cameras. You can see him say a certain word to me at least 10 times. There is no place for that in 2011," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIssues of racism have repeatedly surged on the soccer field in recent years, despite efforts to combat it.\n\n\n\n\n\nChelsea and England captain John Terry is at the center of a investigation by London\'s Metropolitan Police and the English Football Association after allegedly making racist remarks to Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during an October game.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Brazil defender Robert Carlos walked off the field during a Russian league match in June after a banana was thrown at him from the stands, while the Malaysian Football Association was forced to apologize to Chelsea in July when their Israeli midfielder Yossi Benayoun was subject to racial slurs during a pre-season encounter.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut FIFA president Sepp Blatter told CNN this week that he believes there is no on-field racism in the sport.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Maybe one of the players towards the other, he has a word or a gesture which is not the correct one. But also, the one who is affected by that, he should say, \'It\'s a game.\' We are in a game. At the end of the game, we shake hands, this can happen, because we have worked so hard against racism and discrimination," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlatter\'s comments provoked an immediate response from some players, including Manchester United\'s Rio Ferdinand, Anton\'s brother.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Your comments on racism are so condescending (it\'s) almost laughable. If fans shout racist chants but shake our hands is that ok?" he wrote in a Twitter post.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlatter later took to Twitter to explain his comments, posting: "Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, things are said and done on the field of play which are wrong. This does not mean that, in general, there is racism on the field of play.

{'text': 'BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- Argentine farmers are planning their next move after the country\'s president announced plans to fund a public works program with revenues from a controversial agrarian export tax.\n\n\n\nArgentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has rejected demands for the repeal of an export tax.\n\n\n\nEduardo Buzzi, president of the Argentine Agrarian Federation, said the organization\'s directory board will meet Friday to discuss what steps it plans to take in response to President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner\'s announcement.\n\n\n\n"We call on farmers across the country to stay calm but to stay on the alert," the organization said on its Web site Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe 44 percent export tax, which applies to soybeans, wheat, corn and sunflower seeds, has caused a three-month-old standoff between the government and farmers.\n\n\n\nArgentina is the world\'s second-largest corn exporter and third-largest soybean exporter.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, farmers suspended roadblocks that had snarled traffic across the country, though reports indicated that groups in some rural areas were still blocking roads Tuesday.\n\n\n\nKirchner has argued that the tax, which was implemented March 11, pays for increases in seniors\' pensions and financial assistance for the poor.\n\n\n\nShe has rejected the farmers\' demands for a repeal of the export tax as "extortion."\n\n\n\nMonday marked the first time Kirchner revealed details of how the government plans to use profits from the tax, which has generated about U.S. $1.5 billion, to lift people out of poverty.\n\n\n\n"It is impossible to attack the problem of the poor without distribution of revenue and without touching extraordinary profits," she said in a televised address.\n\n\n\nKirchner said the Social Redistribution Program will include the construction of 30 hospitals and more than 300 health-care centers, as well as investments in the country\'s rural roads and in housing.\n\n\n\nIn an apparent criticism of the farmers, she lamented "the reaction of some who refuse to contribute in the redistribution" to "those who have least." She apologized, however, at the close of her speech for offending anyone.\n\n\n\nAnalysts suggested that the tax was a "strong attack" on on the farmers and their arguments against it.\n\n\n\nClaudio Loser, a visiting senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue policy analysis center, said it could result in Argentine society being "less sympathetic to the farmers," noting that it was "surprising" that the government didn\'t come up with the plan until the tax was three months old.\n\n\n\nLoser, who is from Argentina, also predicted that a continuation of the tax would provoke farmers into not investing.\n\n\n\nExternally, the standoff has had a two-pronged effect on Argentina, he said.\n\n\n\n"The conflict has resulted in a loss of market for Argentina," he said, as other countries have gone elsewhere for products.\n\n\n\nLoser also said foreign investors may be more reluctant to invest in Argentina now.\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Carolina Cayazzo and Taylor Gandossy contributed to this report.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What is  the percent tax?', 'answers': ['applies to soybeans, wheat, corn and sunflower seeds,', '44']}, {'question': 'What number of months has  standoff been between farmers and government?', 'answers': ['three-month-old']}, {'question': 'what the 44 percent tax has caused?', 'answers': ['three-month-old standoff between the government and farmers.', 'government and farmers.', 'standoff between', 'a three-month-old standoff between the government and farmers.']}, {'question': "What kind of information did the analyst use to suggests president's plan could turn public tide against farmers?", 'answers': ['tax would provoke', 'continuation of', 'she lamented "the reaction of some who refuse to contribute in the redistribution" to "those who have least."

{'text': '(LonelyPlanet.com) -- Vampires and their stories seem to be enjoying an eternal renaissance in contemporary fiction and film.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnne Rice\'s "Interview with the Vampire" kicked off the modern raft of tales, and the popularity of more recent book and movie offerings like "Twilight" and "True Blood" shows that folks are, well, batty for vampire tales.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo where can you go to learn more about these creatures of the night? Discover the top destinations with this excerpt from Lonely Planet\'s Best in Travel.\n\n\n\n\n\nBran Castle, Romania\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\'s nothing better than going to the source, and in the case of vampire lore that\'s Vlad Ţepeş, legendary ruler of Wallachia, now part of Romania. Ţepeş became the scourge of the Ottoman empire and was fond of impaling entire Turkish forces sent against him. His bloodthirsty reputation inspired Irish author Bram Stoker to use him as the model for "Dracula," and thus a legend was born. Bran Castle, one of his strongholds, now houses a museum dedicated to Queen Marie of Romania. It has an impressive clifftop profile, looking like the quintessential location for a vampire movie.\n\n\n\n\n\nVampire Bats, Costa Rica\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vampire bat has become inseparable from the legend of the vampire. Apparently inspired by a newspaper article about these inhabitants of South and Central America, Bram Stoker wove their blood-sucking habits into his novel and the rest is history (or at least, folklore). These small bats do feed on animals\' blood but rarely suck on humans, though there have been reported attacks in recent years in Brazil and Venezuela. One of the best places to see them in the wild is Costa Rica, especially within Santa Rosa National Park and Corcovado National Park.\n\n\n\n\n\nLonely Planet: How to travel like a kid\n\n\n\n\n\nMusée Des Vampires, France\n\n\n\n\n\nHidden away in the Les Lilas district of Paris is an enigmatic museum devoted to the vampire. Visits can only be made by appointment, but once through the forbidding red door, the visitor is treated to an eclectic collection of books, photographs, weapons, masks, models, costumes and other curios referencing the vampire legend. There\'s also a creepy Gothic garden out the back. The Musée des Vampires.\n\n\n\n\n\nForks, Washington\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen author Stephanie Meyer set her vampire novel "Twilight" in the small town of Forks, Washington, she had little idea of the wave of vampire tourism she was setting in motion. When "Twilight" went ballistic on the bookshelves, ardent fans headed for Forks, neatly arresting the slow economic decline caused by its traditional mainstay, the timber industry, losing momentum. Now vampire fans can buy undead memorabilia, go on tours to locations that resemble Edward and Bella\'s literary hangouts, and celebrate Bella\'s birthday on 13 September. Dazzled by Twilight offers three Twilight-themed tours of Forks and La Push.\n\n\n\n\n\nVampire Tour of San Francisco\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone who\'s read Bram Stoker\'s Dracula will remember Mina Harker, whom Dracula attacked with the intent of transforming her into a vampire. Given that this curse was apparently lifted once he was destroyed, you might be surprised to find Mina Harker wafting about in 21st-century San Francisco, and sporting an American accent. But every weekend you can join Mina for a vampire tour of the city\'s historic Nob Hill. It covers documented San Francisco history as well as speculative supernatural events, and attendees are encouraged to dress spookily. The Vampire Tour of San Francisco commences at 8 p.m. each Friday and Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nDracula Tour of London, UK\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the British capital\'s starring role in the original Dracula novel, it makes sense that there should be a vampire tour of its darker nooks and crannies. This supernatural outing takes in a house in Highgate where the vampiric one apparently lived during his London sojourn. It also takes in the ghosts of Highgate Cemetery, the satanists of Highgate Woods, and other dark denizens. Curiously, the whole thing is then followed with a medieval banquet. Blood, presumably, is not on the menu. The Dracula Tour of London, run by Transylvania Live, takes place nightly except Mondays.\n\n\n\n\n\nPontianak, Indonesia\n\n\n\n\n\nVampiric creatures aren\'t just a Western obsession. Malaysia and Indonesia share the legend of the pontianak, supposedly the undead manifestation of a woman who has died during childbirth. This supernatural being is said to take the form of a beautiful woman, attracting men to their deaths by disemboweling them with her razor-sharp fingernails. You wouldn\'t really want to encounter one of these hellhounds, but if feeling brave you might visit the city of Pontianak, said to be named after the undead creature which once terrorized its men. Pontianak is the capital of the Indonesia province of West Kalimantan, on the island of Borneo.\n\n\n\n\n\nLonely Planet: Hotels where famous people have died\n\n\n\n\n\nDracula\'s Haunts, Whitby, UK\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore "Dracula" reached London in the pages of Bram Stoker\'s novel, he came ashore at Whitby. The North Yorkshire seaport is famous for being the home base of 18th-century explorer Captain James Cook. However, no amount of historic circumstance can top Stoker\'s evocative description of the Russian schooner Demeter blown across Whitby\'s harbour with its dead captain lashed to the helm, crashing beneath the East Cliff before disgorging the vampire in the guise of a huge dog. As a result, Whitby has become a popular destination for vampire-fanciers. The Whitby Gothic Weekend is held twice-yearly, in April and October, and features concerts, markets and comedy nights.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Buffy" locations, USA\n\n\n\n\n\n"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" gained vampires a big new TV audience in the 1990s. If you loved seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar stake scowly-faced evil vampires while finding time to fall in love with a reformed one then you might like to visit the locations in and around Los Angeles where the series was filmed. The series\' exterior scenes at Sunnydale High School were in fact filmed at Torrance High School. Shots of the fictional University of California at Sunnydale were taken at the UCLA campus in Westwood, and at California State University in Northridge. And the vampire mansion once lived in by Angel, Spike and Drusilla is the Frank Lloyd Wright--designed Ennis House near Griffith Park. You can find a comprehensive list of Buffy locations within the IMDb entry for "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."\n\n\n\n\n\n"True Blood" locations, USA\n\n\n\n\n\nBon Temps, Louisiana, is the fictional town in "True Blood," the rightful heir to the vampire-mania stoked by Buffy. As with Buffy, the main character of the show is female, Sookie Stackhouse, who, like Buffy, falls in love with vampires. Unlike Buffy, vampires no longer hide from mainstream society -- they have \'come out of the coffin\' to drink a synthetic human blood (True Blood). But vampires aren\'t the only supernatural citizens of Bon Temps. Werewolves, werepanthers, faeries, shapeshifters and maenads also roam its streets. While all the human characters in the series pass through Merlotte\'s Bar & Grill, the vampires of the show frequent Fangtasia, a bar owned by the thousand-year-old vampire Eric Northman in Shreveport, Louisiana. The actual bar used for some of the filming is located in Long Beach, California, so if you want to be a fang banger then head to Alex\'s Bar. Other True Blood film locations are scattered over Southern USA and California. Seeing Stars has a site dedicated to finding these sights.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally published as "Fangtastic!

{'text': 'LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- An intense manhunt was under way Monday for Chester Stiles, a 37-year old man whom police say is a suspect in the videotaped rape of a 3-year-old girl four years ago.\n\n\n\nChester Arthur Stiles, 37, of Nevada is being sought as a suspect in the videotaped rape of a 3-year-old girl.\n\n\n\nAlso Monday, Stiles\' former girlfriend told CNN she believes she put him in contact with the girl.\n\n\n\nTina Allen said she  is "disgusted" and "mortified" at her role in bringing them together.\n\n\n\nNye County Sheriff Tony De Meo said Friday the girl has been found and is safe. He said the child\'s mother was cooperating with authorities.\n\n\n\nDe Meo addressed Stiles directly: "Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency. Understand this: Law enforcement not only has a long arm but a long memory. You will not be forgotten by members of this agency or any other law enforcement agency."\n\n\n\nStiles\' former girlfriend said she is stunned by the allegations.  Watch Allen describe her first impression of Stiles »\n\n\n\nAllen said she and Stiles had been in an on-again, off-again relationship for 10 years and that he was good with her children.\n\n\n\n"He said he\'d been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be," Allen said.\n\n\n\nAllen took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her 3-year-old daughter, who allegedly was victimized by Stiles.\n\n\n\n"I\'m disgusted. I\'m ashamed, embarrassed, mortified," Allen said. "I regret every, every step I ever took; I feel bad for the baby."\n\n\n\nTodd Allen, Tina Allen\'s son, told CNN he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video. He said his mother and Stiles spent time together there.\n\n\n\nTodd Allen said nobody realized the child may have been abused.\n\n\n\n"She\'s what you\'d expect a little girl in elementary school to be like," he said.\n\n\n\nHe said he never witnessed Stiles physically assault anyone.\n\n\n\n"But I have seen him verbally and mentally assault many people," Todd Allen told CNN.\n\n\n\nLooking back, Tina Allen said there were some warning signs. She said Stiles hit her once but she didn\'t file a police report.\n\n\n\nShe said she blames herself. "How could I not know? Why couldn\'t I have recognized something? Why are all these people going through this torture now because of me?" Allen asked.\n\n\n\nAllen ended her relationship with Stiles a few months ago. She said she believes it will be difficult for police to find him.\n\n\n\n"He will hide out in mountains if that\'s what it takes, he will hide out in a crowd, he\'ll find somebody who hasn\'t heard anything and stay there," she said. "He has skills. He knows how to hunt, I mean hunt with a gun, a knife, a bow."\n\n\n\nAllen said Stiles stopped by her house last week for a friendly visit before his name was linked to the videotape. She said his appearance had changed. She said his hair was longer and he had put on weight.\n\n\n\nStiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, is a former animal trainer, authorities said. De Meo said the FBI also is seeking him in a separate matter involving state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under 14.\n\n\n\nThe man who claimed to have found the tape in the desert and held it for at least five months before handing it over to authorities turned himself in Sunday to Nye County officials.\n\n\n\nDarren Tuck, a Nevada resident who allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces a possible sentence of 10 years to life for exhibiting pornography and another one to six years for possession of child pornography, according to De Meo.\n\n\n\nTuck\'s attorney, Harry Kuehn, said last week on CNN\'s "Nancy Grace" that his client had been "wracked by indecision" as to what to do with the tape once he realized what it was.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A children\'s show host who was born with one hand is facing criticism from parents over her disability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe BBC is receiving complaints about kids\' show host Cerrie Burnell, who was born with one hand.\n\n\n\n\n\nBBC spokeswoman Katya Mira said the corporation has received at least 25 "official" complaints recently about Cerrie Burnell, new host of two shows on the BBC-run CBeebies television network, which is aimed at children younger than 6.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe official complaints do not count the dozens of negative comments lodged in Internet chat rooms, Mira said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one chat room, a father lamented that Burnell being on the show forced him to have conversations with his child about disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there have also been messages of support for Burnell.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Tax day is an annual stress test for millions of Americans, but Wednesday\'s Internal Revenue Service filing deadline may be the toughest one yet for many who can\'t pay their mortgages or rent, let alone a big tax bill.\n\n\n\nJonathan Hermosa wears a costume this week to beckon customers to a tax service office in New York.\n\n\n\n"Our message to taxpayers [is] that we\'re going the extra mile to help those of you in economic distress," IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman told the National Press Club in Washington on Monday.\n\n\n\n"We want to get you your refunds as quickly as possible. And if you think you can\'t pay, please come in and let\'s talk about it. There are steps we can take to help."\n\n\n\niReport contributor Crystal Gress will need to follow some of those steps. The Coplay, Pennsylvania, bank call center employee said she doesn\'t know how she\'s going to pay the $1,200 she owes the IRS. It\'s the first time she\'s had a balance due on April 15.\n\n\n\n"I\'m really scared because I\'ve never had to do it before," said Gress, 23. "I\'m used to getting a return, but this past year has been really rough."  Watch who\'s more likely to get audited »\n\n\n\nGress adjusted her withholding last year to increase her take-home pay to cover bills; she intended the change to be temporary, but car repairs and other expenses kept coming up, she said. She used an estimating tool on tax preparer H&R Block\'s Web site and got the bad news.\n\n\n\n"I was like, \'Oh, crap. I owe money.\' And I don\'t know what to do now," she said. "... I waited until yesterday to do my taxes because I didn\'t want to submit them."\n\n\n\nPeople who know they\'re getting a refund tend to file as early as possible, while those with a balance due tend to file late in the season, IRS spokesman John Lipold said.  Watch last-minute tips from CNN\'s Gerri Willis »\n\n\n\n"A lot of people who were getting refunds in the past are not getting them this year," said Brian Joubert, owner of L&B Tax Service with five locations in the Atlanta, Georgia, area and Houston, Texas.\n\n\n\nBecause his clients usually pay their preparation fees out of their refunds, Joubert\'s company has had to make changes to accommodate them, including cutting fees in select cases, holding checks until payday or taking payments in installments.\n\n\n\n"We\'ve had more people to pay with a credit card this year than I\'ve ever seen," said Joubert, who has been in the tax preparation business for 12 years. "I feel like a department store in some sense."\n\n\n\nThe IRS has a monthly payment plan, but it comes with an upfront fee, stiff penalties and interest, making it more costly than a commercial loan.\n\n\n\nBut a loan isn\'t an option for Gress, whose credit rating is hurt by lingering debt from admittedly unwise earlier choices. After her monthly rent, utilities and car payment, "I barely have enough to buy ramen noodles," Gress said. iReport.com: Read more of Gress\' story\n\n\n\nShe tried to refinance her $5,000 used car but was turned down, and getting a loan from her family is not an option, she said. Her fiancé doesn\'t make much at the auto body shop where he works, and she can\'t work a second job because of long hours at the call center and recent hip surgery. "I\'ve been looking at every option to pay my taxes," she said, acknowledging she\'ll probably have to go with the costly IRS installment plan.\n\n\n\nShe won\'t be alone. Between 2 million and 3 million taxpayers a year follow that route, Lipold said.  Watch what protesters are planning for tax day »\n\n\n\nOthers in similar situations might consider filing for an extension, but they still have to pay extra on any balance not paid by midnight Wednesday.\n\n\n\n"Bring your checkbook when you go to file an extension," said Amy McAnarney, executive director of the Tax Institute at H&R Block. "The tax that isn\'t paid by April 15 is subject to interest and penalties, so it\'s best to pay as much as you can even if you are requesting an extension."\n\n\n\nIn rare cases, the IRS will negotiate with the taxpayer and settle for a smaller amount in what is called an offer in compromise. In 2008, the agency worked out 11,000 offers in compromise (out of about 150 million individual returns) worth about $200 million, Lipold said.\n\n\n\n"The IRS understands that a lot of people are having problems right now economically and is willing to work with them," he said. "If you\'re having a problem, call now."  Watch how your car could earn you a tax break »\n\n\n\nIn contrast to Gress, Joe and Patty Lewis are getting a large tax refund for the first time. The Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, couple are due $7,000, which they said they hope will help save their home, which is in foreclosure.\n\n\n\nJoe Lewis\' job as a senior systems analyst was eliminated in January 2008, and at 56 he hasn\'t found anyone willing to hire him. His $1,800 monthly unemployment benefit -- of which $900 goes to COBRA health care coverage -- runs out at the end of April. iReport.com: Watch Patty Lewis\' iReports\n\n\n\nPatty Lewis, 55, is a former executive with a furniture company who is disabled and no longer able to work. She first shared her story on iReport.com.\n\n\n\nThe $7,000 is mostly a refund of the penalties they paid when they cashed in Joe\'s 401(k) and a deduction for their considerable medical expenses, Patty Lewis said.\n\n\n\nThe Lewises are in talks to take that money and a lump-sum payment of her private long-term disability insurance and make a deal with their lender to settle their mortgage debt, she said.\n\n\n\n"If I cash it in, I\'ll be screwing myself by a couple hundred thousand dollars," she said. "But if it\'s something that\'s going to save me from foreclosure, I\'m willing to do anything I can to secure my home. I\'m offering my lender everything that I possibly have. I\'m praying to God."\n\n\n\nUntil Joe can find a job, "I\'m going to have to live on $900 Social Security a month, which is going to be extremely difficult, but our house is everything to us and it\'s the only thing that I have to offer," she said. Their property taxes are $500 a month, she noted.\n\n\n\nThe couple has filed for mortgage assistance available through national economic stimulus legislation, but Patty Lewis said she doubts they\'ll get it.\n\n\n\n"The administration is not looking at people who have been out of work since this recession started -- December 2007, January 2008. That\'s when my husband lost his job. And they know that a huge part of foreclosures is due to job loss, but yet they still keep addressing the subprime and adjustable-rate victims," she said. "And there\'s nothing out there for us at all. ...

{'text': 'JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- A rocket fired by Palestinian militants fell on a Gaza home and killed two children, Palestinian sources said Friday, the same day Israel opened three Gaza border crossings for the first time in 10 days.\n\n\n\nA truck carrying grain enters Gaza from Israel on Friday at the Karni crossing point, one of three Israel reopened.\n\n\n\nA third child was in critical condition. The children, all girls, were cousins -- the two who died were 7 and 12, and the injured child is 5, Hamas security and Palestinian medical sources said.\n\n\n\nThe rocket struck a house north of Gaza City.\n\n\n\nIn a separate development, the Israeli military said it allowed a Palestinian who was badly wounded by rocket fire Wednesday to enter Israel for treatment. The Palestinian entered Israel through the Erez Crossing between northern Gaza and Israel.\n\n\n\nIsrael closed the crossing for all but humanitarian reasons because of rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel by Palestinian militants. But it opened three other crossings Friday, allowing fuel and commodities into the Palestinian territory for the first time in more than a week.\n\n\n\nAbout 80 trucks filled with commodities were expected to cross into Gaza. Among the goods were 400,000 liters of fuel and 120 tons of cooking gas.\n\n\n\nThe decision to open the crossings at Kerem Shalom, Karni and Nahal Oz came after requests from international aid groups and Egypt, said Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories. In addition, he said, Israel has no desire to hurt the civilian population in Gaza.\n\n\n\nLerner said whether to keep the crossings open would be a daily decision.\n\n\n\nUnited Nations assistance programs in Gaza have run out of flour and several essential pharmaceuticals, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.\n\n\n\nA tenuous six-month truce between the Hamas government in Gaza and Israel expired a week ago. Under the Egyptian-brokered deal, Hamas agreed to end militant attacks on Israel from Gaza, and Israel agreed to halt raids inside the territory and ease its blockade on humanitarian goods.\n\n\n\nIn reality, the truce started breaking down two months ago. Rocket attacks by militants became more frequent, and Israel resumed airstrikes inside Gaza.\n\n\n\nSince then, dozens of rockets have been fired by Palestinian militants into Israel. Israel Defense Forces said about nine rockets have been launched from Gaza since midnight, pushing the three-day total to more than 110. There are no reports of casualties in Israel.\n\n\n\nThe crossings opened a day after Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met in Cairo and Egypt expressed concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n\n\n\nLivni criticized Hamas after her meeting with Mubarak.\n\n\n\n"Hamas needs to understand that Israel\'s basic desire to live in a tranquil region doesn\'t mean that Israel is willing to accept ongoing shooting at its population," she said, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.\n\n\n\n"Enough is enough. We cannot accept this situation, and the situation will change."\n\n\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has threatened to respond to the escalating violence. He warned Hamas again Thursday in an interview on the Al Arabiya television network and seemed to suggest that time was running out.\n\n\n\n"We do not want to fight the Palestinian people, but we will not allow Hamas to strike our children," Olmert said.\n\n\n\n"I did not come here to declare war," he continued.

{'text': '(CNN) -- The murderer of a 16-year-old girl who bragged about his crimes was electrocuted Thursday night, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of Corrections said.\n\n\n\nPaul Warner Powell was pronounced dead at 9:09 p.m. at a correctional center in Jarratt, Virginia. He did not make a last statement at the execution attended by the victim\'s family.\n\n\n\nPowell was convicted in the 1999 murder of Stacie Reed and the rape of her 14-year-old sister in their Manassas, Virginia, family home.\n\n\n\nPowell\'s execution comes after Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell denied him clemency and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block the execution.\n\n\n\nThe killer claimed double jeopardy after state prosecutors put him on trial for a second time in the killing. In July, the high court delayed Powell\'s execution while considering the broader constitutional claims, which were finally rejected. Powell rejected lethal injection, the state\'s usual method of execution.\n\n\n\n"I\'m hopeful this is the last legal chapter in the long history of this case," said Powell\'s prosecutor, Prince William County Commonwealth\'s Attorney Paul Ebert.\n\n\n\n"The survivors -- Stacie\'s mother and [her sister] -- have really been traumatized by delay after delay. Hopefully they\'re going to get some peace and closure after all these years."\n\n\n\nCNN does not identify sexual assault victims without their permission, even though the surviving victim, now 25, has talked publicly about the case.\n\n\n\nThe crime shocked the Washington area. Reed knew Powell, then 20 and an admitted racist. The state\'s highest court eventually threw out the 2000 verdict in the first trial, saying prosecutors had not proven other necessary death-eligible offenses were committed against the 16-year-old. Such "aggravating" factors could include rape, attempted rape or robbery in commission of the murder.\n\n\n\nThe sexual assault and attempted murder of Reed\'s younger sister was upheld, and Powell was given a long prison sentence.\n\n\n\nPowell, believing he was free from execution, proceeded to write a taunting, profanity-filled letter from behind bars to Ebert, laying out explicit details of the crime unknown to investigators at the time.\n\n\n\n"Since I have already been indicted on first degree murder and the Va. Supreme Court said that I can\'t be charged with capital murder again, I figured I would tell you the rest of what happened on Jan. 29, 1999, to show you how stupid all of y\'all ... are," wrote Powell, who is white.\n\n\n\nHe said he had gone to the family\'s home to confront Reed about dating a black man. He admitted pinning the victim, threatening to rape her, then stabbing her in the heart when the girl resisted. He then stomped on her throat.\n\n\n\n"I guess I forgot to mention these events when I was being questioned. Ha Ha!" he wrote in 2001. "Do you just hate yourself for being so stupid ... and saving me?"\n\n\n\nThe killer also said that after that crime, he waited in the house until the younger girl returned from school, then attacked her, leaving her for dead. In the meantime, he drank iced tea from the family refrigerator and smoked a cigarette, part of the forensic evidence that investigators used to place Powell at the scene of the crime.\n\n\n\nWith this first-hand account from Powell, he was indicted again and charged with murder and attempted rape of Stacie Reed -- a capital-eligible crime.

{'text': 'LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN)  -- Royal Dutch Shell said Tuesday that it may not be able to meet its oil supply obligations in Nigeria after an attack on its major pipeline.\n\n\n\nHeavily armed Nigerian rebels pose a constant threat to oil pipelines in the country.\n\n\n\nThe Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), a rebel group, said "detonation engineers backed by heavily armed fighters" sabotaged two of Shell\'s pipelines early Monday.\n\n\n\nAfter a helicopter flyover of the area, Shell confirmed that parts of its large Nembe Creek "trunk line" were damaged, company spokeswoman Caroline Wittgen said. The company shut down some production "to limit the amount of crude that will spill into the environment," she said.\n\n\n\nHours later, it declared "force majeure," a legal term meaning it could not meet its supply obligations in the region because of the attack.\n\n\n\n"[Shell] is working hard to repair the line and restore production," Wittgen said.\n\n\n\nNigeria is the fourth-largest supplier of oil to the United States, and attacks by rebels have helped fuel the year-long spike in crude oil prices. It\'s one of many factors pushing up the price of gas in the U.S., where one in every 10 barrels of oil comes from Nigeria.\n\n\n\nMEND -- the largest rebel group -- has targeted foreign oil companies since 2006. It has bombed pipelines and kidnapped hundreds of foreign oil workers, typically releasing them unharmed, sometimes after receiving a ransom payment.\n\n\n\nMEND hopes to secure a greater share of oil wealth for people in the delta, where more than 70 percent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day.\n\n\n\nIts attacks on oil facilities have taken a toll.\n\n\n\n"Anytime a pipeline is affected, anytime any production gets shut down, you see oil prices jump up one or two dollars a barrel just because there is no slack in the system," said Jim LeCamp, a senior vice president with RBC Wealth Management, which manages assets for wealthy clients worldwide.\n\n\n\nExxon and Shell are two of several companies that have been extracting 2 million barrels of oil a day in Nigeria. Recent rebel attacks on oil pipelines in the Niger Delta have cut overall production by roughly 10 percent -- meaning 200,000 fewer barrels of oil on some days.\n\n\n\nThat decrease in production comes at a time of increased demand from oil-hungry regions such as China, Russia and Latin America.\n\n\n\n"Anytime there\'s a disruption there, it really affects the system," LeCamp said in a recent interview with CNN.', 'qa': [{'question': "How many of Shell's pipeliens were attacked?", 'answers': ['two of', 'parts of its large Nembe Creek "trunk line"', 'sabotaged two', 'pipelines']}, {'question': "Who sabatoged Shell's oil pipelines?", 'answers': ['"detonation engineers backed', 'Heavily armed Nigerian rebels', 'heavily armed fighters"', 'The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), a rebel group,', 'a rebel group,']}, {'question': 'What will Shell might not be able to meet?', 'answers': ['oil supply', 'obligations in Nigeria']}, {'question': 'When were the pipelines attacked?', 'answers': ['early Monday.', '2006.', 'Tuesday', 'Nigeria']}, {'question': 'Who may not meet supply contracts?', 'answers': ['Royal Dutch Shell']}, {'question': 'What company is working to repair lines and get production running?', 'answers': ['Shell', '"[Shell]', 'Royal Dutch Shell']}, {'question': 'Are the lines going to be repaired?', 'answers': ['and restore production,"', '"[Shell] is working hard', 'repair the']}, {'question': 'What did Shell say after the attack?', 'answers': ['an', 'obligations', 'it may not be able to meet its oil supply', 'on its major pipeline.', 'obligations in Nigeria', 'said Tuesday that it may not be able to meet its oil supply']}, {'question': 'What was sabotaged?', 'answers': ["Shell's pipelines", "two of Shell's pipelines"]}, {'question': "What happened to two of Shell's pipelines?", 'answers': ['of', 'an attack', '"detonation engineers backed by heavily armed fighters" sabotaged']}, {'question': 'What is the company working to do?', 'answers': ['repair the line and restore production,"']}]}

{'text': 'WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Terror attacks have spiked dramatically in Afghanistan and Pakistan as extremists in both countries strengthen their power and expand operations, according to a State Department report released Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan, like this bombing in April, has more than quadrupled from 2006 to 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the State Department annual terrorism report notes an overall decline in attacks worldwide and fewer attacks in Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe attacks worldwide have decreased by 20 percent, with 30 percent fewer fatalities, said Russell Travers of the National Counterterrorism Center.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report says al Qaeda and its extremist supporters have moved across the Afghan border "to the remote areas of the Pakistani frontier, where they have used this terrain as a safe haven to hide, train terrorists, communicate with the followers, plot attacks and send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan."\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Pakistan alone, the report says, attacks more than quadrupled between 2006 and 2008, with a sharp increase in their "coordination, sophistication and frequency." Last year there were 1,839 terrorist "incidents," compared with 890 in 2007, Travers said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rise in violence has complicated the Obama administration\'s effort to implement its strategy of boosting military and civilian programs in both countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report says the largest number of attacks occurred in Pakistani provinces near the Afghan border, including Balochistan, the North West Frontier and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, where extremists have sought to challenge the government and extend Islamic law.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also notes the government\'s inability to get a handle on the extremists. Despite having 80,000 to 100,000 troops in those provinces, it says, "the government of Pakistan\'s authority in the area continued to be challenged."\n\n\n\n\n\nRonald Schlicher, the State Department\'s acting coordinator of counterterrorism, told reporters the Obama administration has "real concerns" that al Qaeda\'s senior leadership may be operating from those areas and could be plotting attacks against the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We have a real sense that it\'s happening, but we have imperfect knowledge of what they\'re doing," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPakistan\'s military in the past week launched an assault on militants in Taliban-held areas after they seized territory in violation of an agreement signed this year by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. The deal, criticized by the United States, allowed the Taliban to implement Islamic law, or sharia, in the region in exchange for an end to fighting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recent operations are part of the Pakistani army\'s intensified drive against the Taliban in its restive tribal regions. The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan. As a result, the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan. The strikes have rankled relations between the two countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nPakistan has asked the United States to supply its forces with helicopters, communication equipment and night-vision technology as part of a U.S. plan to beef up the country\'s counterterrorism efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Obama told reporters Wednesday night that he is "gravely concerned about the situation in Pakistan."\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a news conference capping his 100th day in office, Obama said the United States has "huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable" and doesn\'t end up a "nuclear-armed militant state."\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter making two visits to Pakistan in less than three weeks, Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, is "very alarmed by the growing extremist threat in Pakistan and remains frustrated particularly by the political leaderships\' inability to confront that threat," according to his chief spokesman.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates have called Taliban gains in Pakistan an "existential threat" to the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe State Department report notes the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, in November, attributing them to the Pakistan-based Kashmir terrorist group Laskhar-e-Tayyiba and to its fundraising subsidiary, amaat ud-Dawa. Although Pakistan has cracked down on some of the groups\' camps and made several arrests, the report warned of continuing tension between India and Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report says Afghanistan is plagued by "an insurgency that more and more relied on vicious and increasingly sophisticated terrorist attacks," despite the efforts of NATO forces and the Afghan government.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The anti-government insurgency remained a capable, determined and resilient threat to stability and to the expansion of government authority," the report warns. Although the Taliban continued to suffer heavy combat loses, the report says its ability to leverage support from al Qaeda and recruit soldiers "remained undiminished."\n\n\n\n\n\n"Taliban information operations were increasingly aggressive and sophisticated," it says. "Streams of Taliban financing from across the border in Pakistan, along with funds gained from narcotics trafficking, have allowed the insurgency to strengthen its military and technical capabilities."\n\n\n\n\n\nIran is also a source of training to the Taliban "on small-unit tactics, small arms, explosives and indirect-fire weapons," the report says.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Since at least 2006, Iran has arranged arms shipments including small arms and associated ammunition, rocket-propelled grenades, mortar rounds, 107 mm rockets and plastic explosives to select Taliban members," it says.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile terrorists in Iraq still launched attacks last year, "there was a notable reduction in the number of security incidents throughout much of the country, including a decrease in civilian casualties, enemy attacks, and improvised explosive device attacks in the last quarter of the year," the report says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were 3,258 terrorist incidents in 2008, down almost half from the 6,210 attacks in 2007, Travers said. He added there was a decrease during the first quarter of 2009, although there has a been a spike in terrorist attacks in April.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the threat from al Qaeda in Iraq "continued to diminish" due to significant defections and a loss of both territory and funding, al Qaeda continued to benefit from safe haven in Somalia and has strengthened its North African operations, the report says.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt notes a sharp increase in attacks by al Qaeda affiliates in North Africa. In Algeria, many of the attacks were blamed on al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, whose tactics "appeared to be influenced by [al Qaeda\'s] experience in Iraq."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also warns "the security situation in Yemen continued to deteriorate during 2008 and was marked by a series of attacks against both Western and Yemeni interests," culminating in the September 17 suicide bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa that killed 18.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Recruitment for al Qaeda in Yemen (AQY) remained strong, and the use of vehicle borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) and suicide vests indicated a high level of training, coordination, and sophistication by Yemen\'s terrorist leadership," the report says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report calls the government\'s response to the terrorist threat "intermittent and its ability to pursue and prosecute suspected terrorists remained weak due to a number of shortcomings, including stalled draft counterterrorism legislation."\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough a raid in August on an al Qaeda in Yemen cell in the country uncovered large number of weapons, the report warns the action "did little to deter or disrupt other AQY cells."\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a month later that at least seven assailants dressed in Yemeni security-service uniforms attacked the U.S. Embassy with explosives and suicide vests, launching what the report calls a "sophisticated and well-coordinated" attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report says Iran "remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism," including supporting terrorist groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, all of which opposed the Middle East peace process, as well as Iraq-based militants and the Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt cites the Qods Force, an elite branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as the regime\'s "primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting terrorists abroad."\n\n\n\n\n\n"Iran\'s involvement in the planning and financial support of terrorist attacks throughout the Middle East, Europe and Central Asia had a direct impact on international efforts to promote peace, threatened economic stability in the Gulf, and undermined the growth of democracy," the report says.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchlicher also said that the United States is "troubled by indications that the Iranians may be seeking to extend their influence into other parts of the world and expand its military ties into Latin America."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration has adopted a policy of engagement with Iran in an effort to curb its nuclear ambitions.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What borders are the supporters moving towards?', 'answers': ['the Afghan', 'Pakistani']}, {'question': 'What does the report show?', 'answers': ['overall decline in attacks worldwide', 'an overall decline in attacks worldwide and fewer attacks in Iraq.', 'Terror attacks have spiked dramatically in Afghanistan and Pakistan']}, {'question': 'Who is moving across Afghan border?', 'answers': ['extremist supporters', 'al Qaeda and', 'al Qaeda']}, {'question': 'how many attacks are there', 'answers': ['6,210', 'in 2008,', 'in 2007,', '1,839', '3,258']}, {'question': 'What does the report say about Iran?', 'answers': ['"Iran\'s involvement in the planning and financial support of terrorist attacks throughout the Middle East, Europe and Central Asia had a direct impact on international efforts to promote peace, threatened economic stability in the Gulf, and undermined the growth of democracy,"', '"remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism,"', 'arranged arms shipments including small arms and associated ammunition, rocket-propelled grenades, mortar rounds, 107 mm rockets and plastic explosives to select Taliban members,"', 'source of training to the Taliban "on small-unit tactics, small arms, explosives and indirect-fire weapons,"', 'is also a source of training to the Taliban', 'a source of training to the Taliban "on small-unit tactics, small arms, explosives and indirect-fire weapons,"']}, {'question': 'Where have attacks quadrupled?', 'answers': ['Pakistan,']}, {'question': 'Which country is most active in sponsoring terrorism?', 'answers': ['Iran']}, {'question': 'who is attacking pakistan', 'answers': ['al Qaeda and its extremist supporters', 'al Qaeda', 'terrorist', 'extremists']}, {'question': 'were there any deaths', 'answers': ['18.', '30 percent fewer fatalities,']}]}

{'text': '(Mental Floss) -- From the moment Justice David Souter announced he\'d be stepping down, Washington has been gearing up for a confirmation fight. But as Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told Judge Sonia Sotomayor yesterday, "Unless you have a complete meltdown, you are going to get confirmed."\n\n\n\nRobert Bork is not the only nominee who did not make it to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nLet\'s take a look back at eight nominees who didn\'t make it to the bench, at least on their first try.\n\n\n\n1. Robert Bork\n\n\n\nIn our time, the most famous rejected nominee is Robert H. Bork, a legal scholar and U.S. Court of Appeals judge with a long paper trail of conservative opinions. Nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987, Bork could have tilted the Court decisively to the right.\n\n\n\nAs a known quantity, he was an easy target for liberal opponents, who organized a campaign against him. He was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee after 12 days of hearings. Mental Floss: Washington\'s struggle to find a chief justice\n\n\n\n2. Alexander Wolcott\n\n\n\n"Oh degraded Country! How humiliating to the friends of moral virtue -- of religion and of all that is dear to the lover of his Country!" the New-York Gazette Advertiser wailed in 1811 over President James Madison\'s nomination of customs inspector Alexander Wolcott.\n\n\n\nWolcott\'s strong enforcement of the controversial embargoes against Great Britain and France cost him support in the Senate and in the press.\n\n\n\nThe Senate turned him down by a 9-24 vote, the widest rejection in Supreme Court history.\n\n\n\n3. Roger Taney\n\n\n\nRoger B. Taney (pronounced tawny) is largely remembered as the chief justice who handed down the Dred Scott decision in 1857. With his sepulchral countenance, Taney is inextricably linked to the grim ruling that all blacks -- slaves as well as free -- were not and could never become citizens of the United States.\n\n\n\nBut when President Andrew Jackson nominated him in 1835 as associate justice, opposition Whigs were still smarting from Taney\'s removal of government deposits from the Second Bank of the United States while he was a recess-appointed Secretary of the Treasury. The Senate voted to indefinitely postpone the nomination.\n\n\n\nHowever, after Chief Justice John Marshall died in 1836, Jackson sent Taney\'s name up again. He was confirmed, this time as chief justice.\n\n\n\n4. Ebenezer Hoar\n\n\n\nYou might think the Senate just couldn\'t stomach elevating to the highest court in the land a man with the name Ebenezer Hoar, but it seems the senators were offended by something other than aesthetics.\n\n\n\nAs President Ulysses S. Grant\'s attorney general, Hoar had insisted on rewarding merit rather than political loyalty, thus blocking a well-trod route for patronage. So when Grant nominated Hoar to the Court in 1869, miffed Republican senators gave the virtuous Hoar thumbs down. Mental Floss: What was Marbury v. Madison? Who were Roe and Wade?\n\n\n\n5 and 6. Wheeler Hazard Peckham and William B. Hornblower\n\n\n\nA senator has the right to reject a court nomination simply because the nominee is from the senator\'s home state. Upon this invocation of "senatorial courtesy" rests the demise of Wheeler Hazard Peckham and William B. Hornblower.\n\n\n\nBoth men were nominated by President Grover Cleveland. Both nominees were New Yorkers, and New York Sen. David Hill invoked senatorial courtesy to squelch their nominations in 1894. (Peckham\'s brother, Rufus Wheeler Peckham, became a justice in 1896.)\n\n\n\n7. Harriet Miers\n\n\n\nSome nominees withdrew themselves from consideration before they could be rejected. Such was the case of Harriet Miers, whom President George W. Bush nominated in 2005, but withdrew under criticism that she was unqualified. Mental Floss: Why there\'s a Mohammed statue at the Supreme Court?\n\n\n\n8. Douglas Ginsburg\n\n\n\nAnother withdrawal was that of Douglas Ginsburg (not related to current justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg), the conservative, former pot-smoking federal appellate judge who is a footnote in the Bork saga.\n\n\n\nAfter Bork was Borked, Reagan eyed the more moderate Anthony Kennedy for the seat. But Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) threatened a filibuster. So Reagan turned right again and proposed Ginsburg. But there was no getting around the revelation that Ginsburg had inhaled. Ginsburg withdrew himself from consideration, Reagan put forward Kennedy and the Senate, eager to move on, easily confirmed him.\n\n\n\nFor more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com', 'qa': [{'question': 'Who degraded the country?', 'answers': ['Alexander Wolcott']}, {'question': 'How many nominees failed to get a seat?', 'answers': ['eight', 'the bench,', "who didn't make it"]}, {'question': 'how many people have failed to get a seat', 'answers': ['eight nominees', 'eight']}, {'question': 'Who else was rejected', 'answers': ['Douglas Ginsburg', 'William B.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Officials with the Iowa Lottery are seeking the winner of a $10.75 million Hot Lotto jackpot who has until 4 p.m. Thursday to claim it.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Someone legitimately won this money and we want them to take it home," lottery CEO Terry Rich said in a news release. "But you must present the winning ticket to the lottery in order to claim the prize."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ticket, which was bought December 29, 2010, at a QuikTrip in Des Moines, must be redeemed by 4 p.m. Thursday. The ticket matched all six numbers: 3-12-16-26-33 and Hot Ball 11.\n\n\n\n\n\nFew financial advisers would consider the $1 spent on the ticket to have been a wise investment. The buyer overcame 1 in 10.9 million odds to win, said Mary Neubauer, a spokeswoman for the state lottery. If the ticket is redeemed, the winner would owe 25% in federal taxes and 5% in state taxes, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the possibility of taxes and the absence of a ticket haven\'t deterred the hopeful from lining up -- just in case. "We\'ve been getting calls from the public all day long today," Neubauer said Wednesday night. "The closer that the deadline gets, the more people seem to be calling."\n\n\n\n\n\nHuge-money ticket in Georgia goes unclaimed\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the calls are from people who say they may have lost the ticket, or put it through a washing machine, she said. They are walked through a series of questions to determine whether they may indeed be the winner. So far, no luck.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther calls, she said, are from people who believe in the power of their own creativity. Once told they could not have been the winner, they call back again -- and again, each time with a different story, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"That\'s why we keep emphasizing that it comes down to -- you have to have the winning ticket," she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the prize goes unclaimed, the money would return to the 15 lotteries that offer the game -- in proportion to the percentage of sales that came from each state. "Iowa would get back about $1.3 million if this prize were to go unclaimed," Rich said.\n\n\n\n\n\nStates differ on how they would use the money. In Iowa, the money would go into the prize pools for future games.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough a $77 million jackpot went unclaimed this week in Georgia, such cases are exceedingly rare, said Neubauer.', 'qa': [{'question': 'How much  jackpot went unclaimed this week in Georgia?', 'answers': ['$10.75 million']}, {'question': 'What is set to expire at 4 p.m.?', 'answers': ['The ticket,', '$10.75 million Hot Lotto jackpot']}, {'question': 'What percentage of large jackpots are not claimed?', 'answers': ['exceedingly rare,']}, {'question': 'What is the jackpot that is set to expire?', 'answers': ['$10.75 million']}, {'question': 'Who said "You must present the ticket in order to claim the prize,"?', 'answers': ['CEO Terry Rich', 'Terry Rich', 'lottery CEO Terry Rich']}, {'question': 'What jackpot went unclaimed in Georgia?', 'answers': ['$77 million', '$10.75 million Hot Lotto', '$10.75 million']}, {'question': 'Was the $10.75 million jackpot claimed?', 'answers': ['unclaimed', 'who has until 4 p.m. Thursday to claim it.', 'seeking the winner']}, {'question': 'When does the jackpot expire?', 'answers': ['4 p.m. Thursday']}]}

Targets included two luxury hotels, the Oberoi and the Taj Mahal, as well as a cafe popular with Western tourists.\n\nA man told a local television station that he was in the Oberoi around 10 p.m. Wednesday when gunmen entered the lobby and began rounding up guests, asking for anyone with a U.S. or British passport and taking about 15 of them hostage.\n\nFire raged at the Oberoi, the scene of much bloodshed as explosions and gunshots rang out Thursday morning. Outside the Taj Mahal, screaming and fighting broke out as reporters scrambled to capture the chaotic scene.\n\nAustralian filmmaker Anthony Rose told CNN that he had just arrived at the Oberoi hotel when he heard gunshots in the lobby and saw a fellow Australian shot in the leg and then shot at close range in the head by one of the attackers.\n\nHe said that he and others in his film crew fled through back doors in the hotel to escape the shooters.\n\nAmong those killed in the two days of violence was British yachtsman Andreas Liveras, according to St. George\'s Hospital in Mumbai.\n\nAt least one French national is trapped in the Oberoi hotel, according to the French Foreign Ministry in Paris.\n\nA woman from Nashville, Tennessee, was shot in the arm and leg by the attackers, who barged into a ballroom at her hotel, her husband told CNN affiliate WSMV.\n\nAndi Varagona operates a holistic health clinic in Nashville and was in Mumbai for training, her husband, Santos Lopez, told the station.\n\nAccording to Lopez, his wife called him and said, "We were ambushed and we were shot."\n\nWhen he asked Varagona if she was all right, she told him she had been shot in the leg and arm and was at that moment being wheeled into surgery, Lopez said.\n\n"My God, I cried more than I cried in my entire life," Lopez told WSMV. "I mean, it\'s just been so overwhelming with emotion. ... You tend to believe that things that happen in the world happen to other people, until it happens to you."  Watch hostages walk from the building looking dazed Â»\n\nWSMV is reporting that Varagona came out of surgery Wednesday night -- a bullet removed from her leg.\n\nAn American woman, who was still inside the Taj with her husband, told CNN by phone Thursday that television feeds into the rooms had stopped and she did not know what was going on.\n\n"We have water and we\'re hunkered down and patient and ready to wait it out," she said. "We\'re OK. Last night was a different story, but today we\'re OK."\n\nThe woman, whom CNN is not identifying so as not to disclose her location to the gunmen, said she heard gunfire outside her room Wednesday night and "a man with an American accent screaming for help."\n\nAparna Dash, an American who lives in Pennsylvania but is visiting Mumbai on business, was staying at the Oberoi hotel. She was on the phone with her husband, who was in the United States, when the first explosions rang out.\n\n"She thought it was firecrackers and didn\'t think much of it," her husband, Biswa Dash, told CNN. "But then in the coming hours, she realized what was going on and all the people in the hotel began trying to get out, to rush down the stairs."\n\nAparna Dash had made it down to the fifth floor from her room on the 26th floor, her husband said, and found an American woman sitting on the stairs, dazed and crying. iReport.com: Are you there? Share your story and send photos and video\n\n"They were telling [the woman] that she needed to get up and keep moving," said Biswa Dash, recounting what his wife told him. "She was crying and saying that there were all these people piled on top of each other and that the armed men had come at them just straight on -- without masks, without trying to hide their faces at all. Just charging at them with their ammunition and their AK-47s."\n\nIndian Prime Minister Moanmohan Singh said the attackers were likely foreigners, but he did not name a country where he believed they were from. Officially, the Indian authorities are saying no one has claimed responsibility. A group called the Deccan Mujahideen took credit in e-mails sent to several Indian news outlets.\n\nAuthorities found 8 kilograms (17 pounds) of RDX, one of the most powerful military explosives, at a restaurant near the Taj, indicating that the attackers may have been planning more violence.\n\nA woman whom CNN is only identifying by her first name -- Andrea -- spoke to CNN from Mumbai, where she is visiting for her brother\'s wedding. She is staying at a hotel a few blocks from the Taj.\n\nShe heard the explosions Wednesday and then immediately got a call from her brother, who lives in Hong Kong. He was worried, saying that he had heard reports of gunfire. "And we were like, \'Yeah, gunshots, we\'re from New Orleans, whatever,\' " Andrea said.\n\nA few hours later, she said, her brother called back and said, "This is a big deal, put on the TV."\n\n"That\'s when we figured out what was going on," Andrea said.\n\n"Over the course of the night we heard maybe three explosions, some emergency vehicles, sirens. For the most part the street was really quiet," she said. "We\'ve been watching the news the whole time, just like everyone else."\n\nShe needed water, so she left her hotel and a person at a restaurant helped her, she said.

{'text': '(Wired)  -- Google is set to become your new phone company, perhaps reducing your phone bill to zilch in the process.\n\n\n\nSeriously.\n\n\n\nGoogle has bought Gizmo5, an online phone company that is akin to Skype  but based on open protocols and with a lot fewer users. TechCrunch, which broke the news on Monday, reported that Google spent $30 million on the company.\n\n\n\nGoogle announced the Gizmo acquisition on Thursday afternoon Pacific Time. Gizmo5\'s founder Michael Robertson, a brash serial entrepreneur, will become an Adviser to Google Voice.\n\n\n\nIt\'s a potent recipe -- take Gizmo5\'s open standards-based online calling system. Add to it the new ability to route calls on Google\'s massive network of cheap fiber. Toss in Google Voice\'s free phone number, which will ring your mobile phone, your home phone and your Gizmo5 client on your laptop. ÿþ\n\n\n\nMeanwhile you can use Gizmo5 to make ultracheap outgoing calls to domestic and international phone numbers, and free calls to Skype, Google Talk, Yahoo and AIM users. You could make and receive calls that bypass the per-minute billing on your smartphone.\n\n\n\nThen layer on deluxe phone services like free SMS, voicemail transcription, customized call routing, free conference calls and voicemails sent as recordings to your e-mail account, and you have a phone service that competes with Skype, landlines and the Internet telephone offerings from Vonage and cable companies.\n\n\n\nThat\'s not just pie in-the-sky dreaming.\n\n\n\nAsk longtime VOIP watcher and consultant Andy Abramson, who introduced the idea of integrating Gizmo5 and Grand Central (now Google Voice), long before Google bought either.\n\n\n\n"Google is now the the uncommon carrier," Abramson said, punning on the iconic 7-UP commercials and the phrase "common carrier." That refers to phone companies that operate on the traditional publicly switched network -- a status that gives them benefits and obligations.\n\n\n\n"If AT&T is Coca-Cola, Google is now 7-UP," Abramson added.\n\n\n\n"All of a sudden you have something that offers more than Skype," Abramson said, saying the combo could now put Google in competition with phone and cable companies, IP "telephony" (VOIP) companies and Vonage. "But now you can do everything with Google and pay nothing and have a platform where engineers can build new things."\n\n\n\nIn fact, Gizmo5 offered a rogue version of that service for $6 a month until last week.\n\n\n\nOn November 2, Gizmo5 abruptly canceled the two-month old "residential service," which paired the free phone number available through Google Voice with Gizmo\'s Internet calling service to provide the equivalent of a home-phone replacement like Vonage.\n\n\n\nNow, that service has been wiped off the Internet and, more intriguingly, Google\'s cache of the page disappeared the day after the acquisition was reported.\n\n\n\nFor $6 a month, Gizmo5 residential users got 300 minutes a month of outbound calling anywhere in the United States, unlimited incoming calls on their home computers or even home phones (using a broadband-to-phone network conversion box) and E911 service (which means 911 calls work like landlines calls do, once you register your home address).\n\n\n\nIt\'s not too surprising that offer got taken down.\n\n\n\nFor one Google is already trying to steer clear of U.S. regulators by making it clear that Google Voice isn\'t a replacement for a home phone since you have to have phone service from some other company to use it. You can forward calls from a Google Voice number to your Gizmo5 number, but you must have a mobile or landline number as well.\n\n\n\nGoogle doesn\'t say it, but clearly it hopes that restriction will keep the service from incurring the common carrier obligations attached to the regular phone system (PSTN), and the 911 and wiretapping requirements that apply to Internet telephony and to traditional copper wire phones.\n\n\n\nAT&T has already tried to sic federal regulators on Google Voice because Google is blocking outgoing calls to a handful of shady calling services  mostly free conference-calling services that exploit federal rules that let rural phone companies charge high fees to connect calls to rural areas.\n\n\n\nAT&T itself has sued similar services that play this arbitrage game, and complaining to the feds may have only brought more attention to an issue the FCC has procrastinating fixing for too long.\n\n\n\nGizmo5 will also help save Google money on phone-call termination fees as users start to use computer-based clients to connect to Google Voice. That would allow Google to recoup the purchase price of $30 million in little time, if only it saves even a few dollars per user per year.\n\n\n\nGoogle also gets Michael Robertson, a troublemaker with technical chops. Robertson made millions from MP3.com in the dot-com boom, despite drawing lawsuits from major record labels for creating innovative services. He was later sued by Microsoft for his startup Lindows, which made Linux installations for cheap PCs. And his current music venture, MP3tunes.com, is being sued by EMI.\n\n\n\nThough still in invite-only mode, Google Voice has about 580,000 active users and nearly 1.5 million registered users, according to a Google filing with the FCC.\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in the combination, you might want to sign up for Gizmo5 before the acquisition is formally announced, since Google often freezes new registrations at companies it acquires until it figures out how to integrate the technology.\n\n\n\nSubscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

{'text': 'PHOENIX, Arizona  -- New England\'s failure to protect star quarterback Tom Brady proved the decisive factor as the Patriots flunked their chance of a perfect 19-0 season and Super Bowl glory.\n\n\n\nBrady is sacked by defensive end Michael Strahan in the third guarter of the Super Bowl.\n\n\n\nBrady has weaved his magic behind an all but impregnable offensive line all season but not on Sunday as he was sacked five times in the 17-14 defeat to the New York Giants.\n\n\n\n"They have some great pressure schemes, obviously some great pass rushers," Brady said.\n\n\n\n"Once we kind of got the idea of what we were doing, I thought we handled it much better, but we didn\'t get the ball in the end zone enough."\n\n\n\nComing in, Brady had been sacked a career-low 24 times this season playing behind a line that produced three Pro Bowlers in Koppen, left tackle Matt Light and left guard Logan Mankins.\n\n\n\nThrow in right guard Stephen Neal and right tackle Nick Kaczur, and Brady played most of his record-breaking season not having to worry much about getting hit by bloodthirsty defenders.\n\n\n\n"I like when I don\'t get touched," Brady said earlier in the week.\n\n\n\nThen, disaster struck -- in the form of an all-out, pressure-packed swarming defensive attack by the Giants -- in the worst possible setting. It was the first time Brady had been sacked as many as five times since the New York Jets did it on Sept. 21, 2003.\n\n\n\nNew England had no answer for the Giants\' bulldozing defense.\n\n\n\n"If I could tell you, we\'d have it fixed," running back Kevin Faulk said. "At the same time, they outplayed us."\n\n\n\nThey sure did, and left Brady wondering what hit him. Brady simply had no time to find Randy Moss and his other targets on a regular basis against the Giants.\n\n\n\nWith 19 seconds left in the game and the Patriots facing a do-or-die scenario, Brady was sacked for the final time when Jay Alford pulled him down at New England\'s 16-yard line.\n\n\n\nBrady was left with nothing to do but try two straight desperation heaves to Moss to no avail.\n\n\n\n"I think their intensity from the beginning snap to the end of the game was really higher than ours," Moss said. "We just couldn\'t meet that intensity."\n\n\n\nWith help from their linemen, the Patriots set NFL records for points scored and total touchdowns, while Brady broke the league mark for TD passes and Moss set the record for scoring receptions. That high-powered offense was held to a season-low 14 points in the Super Bowl -- mostly because it couldn\'t get time.\n\n\n\n"They played well defensively," coach Bill Belichick said.

(Says mom Kris Jenner: "Who knew she would be that excited about a baby-food maker? I bought her a million handbags, and I never got that reaction.") I steam and puree fruits and vegetables, and they last for like four days.\n\n\n\n\n\nMason pretty much loves everything. I gave him red beets, and it got all over his face, which made the funniest picture. He also loves sweet potatoes, carrots, and yams. Sometimes I mix pureed peaches, pears, bananas, or apples with plain yogurt or an all-natural organic jelly. I have this great book called "Super Baby Food" that\'s full of ideas. I should be on this Mason diet!\n\n\n\n\n\nParenting.com: Adorable outtakes from Kourtney and Mason\'s New York photo shoot\n\n\n\n\n\n\'I have no desire to go out\'\n\n\n\n\n\nUnless I\'m working, I can\'t be away from him without feeling guilty. It doesn\'t feel good or natural to be, so it\'s a struggle. My friends keep saying, "You and [boyfriend Scott Disick] should go out and eat or do something."\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently my sister Kim watched Mason so we could go to dinner. It took so long -- actually, it probably didn\'t take so long, but to us it felt like it took long -- we were like, should we just get pizza and go home? Scott says he doesn\'t need to wine and dine me anymore. We would be just as happy having a slice of pizza sitting in bed with our son.\n\n\n\n\n\n\'Mason sleeps in bed with me\'\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I\'ve had a long day, then I have that time at night, which is really important to me. Mason did fall on the floor once by mistake. It was the worst moment. I freaked out and looked online [to research the dangers associated with a baby falling off the bed]. He was fine but crying, so I e-mailed the doctor at four in the morning. He wrote me right back, yet I stayed up all night to watch him sleep to make sure he was okay.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\'ve since lowered our mattress to the floor. I put pillows all around the floor, too. I am doing the best that I can, and I feel really confident in that. Unless someone has walked in your shoes, you really can\'t judge. Everyone needs to make the best choice for their life.

I need to have energy for my son, and I haven\'t worked out since. I take Mason on a lot of walks.

When I am out or away, that\'s when I most want to be with Mason. I do have help when I\'m working. It\'s important to have one person I trust, so I know Mason is taken care of.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut every time I am not working, he is with me. Even on an airplane, he is with me even if the nanny is also on the plane. Any time I can have with him, I am lucky to have. I also have a big family.

If I don\'t have something, it\'s not a big deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n"She\'s independent, she knows I\'ve had six kids, but she wants to do her own thing," Kris Jenner says. "She is showing she can do it on her own. And by the way, I am impressed."\n\n\n\n\n\n\'We don\'t really follow a set schedule\'\n\n\n\n\n\nI was struggling with that for a while, wondering what is the best thing. I think you do whatever fits your lifestyle. Some people have things planned from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., which works for them. But honestly, the best thing for Mason is just to be with me. When we are out, we just have so much fun. If we are cruising around, and he is napping in the car, it\'s not the worst thing in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nParenting.com: Which baby strollers are celebs pushing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\'Mason comes first, and if that makes me unprofessional at times, so be it\'\n\n\n\n\n\nEspecially during the first three months, I didn\'t care if I was late.

{'text': 'Peppermint oil, soluble fiber, and antispasmodic drugs can indeed help people with irritable bowel syndrome, according to an analysis of 25 years of research on the condition, which is characterized by bouts of diarrhea and constipation.\n\n\n\n"It wasn\'t appreciated how much of an impact [IBS] can have on a patient\'s quality of life," says one researcher.\n\n\n\nAbout 10 to 15 percent of people in North America have IBS, and it\'s twice as common in women. However, only about one-third of people with the intestinal disorder seek treatment.\n\n\n\nThe exact cause of IBS remains unknown, and that lack of knowledge has led to the use of a variety of treatments, including fiber supplements, probiotics, antidepressants, behavioral-based therapies, psychotherapy, food modification, acupuncture, and laxatives. However, many treatments are controversial because study results have been mixed.\n\n\n\nNewer and more expensive medications have been introduced to the public, but some were ineffective or withdrawn from the market due to side effects. The recent study sheds light on the cheap and readily available treatments that can help patients, says study coauthor Eamonn M. Quigley, M.D., a professor of medicine and physiology at University College Cork in Ireland.\n\n\n\n"Medical science has tended to ignore IBS; it wasn\'t appreciated how much of an impact it can have on a patient\'s quality of life," he says. Health.com: Is that belly ache in your head?\n\n\n\nIn the new analysis, researchers systematically reviewed 38 studies from the last 25 years; more than 2,500 volunteers were involved. That research compared therapies -- all relatively cheap, safe, and readily available -- with a placebo or with no treatment at all.\n\n\n\nThe team looked at three treatments -- soluble fiber, peppermint oil, and antispasmodics, which are drugs that relax the smooth muscle in the gut and relieve cramping -- and found that they were all more effective than a placebo, according to the report in the British Medical Journal.\n\n\n\nBut not all fiber is the same. The soluble fiber ispaghula husk, which is also known as psyllium and found in some bulk laxatives, significantly reduced symptoms of  IBS, particularly constipation; insoluble fiber, such as bran, did not relieve symptoms.\n\n\n\nSeveral antispasmodic drugs helped prevent IBS symptoms, particularly diarrhea. The most effective one was hyoscine, which is sold without a prescription in the United States.\n\n\n\nAlthough peppermint oil was found to be the most effective of the three therapies, more data are needed, cautions Quigley. The peppermint-oil therapy was analyzed in only four trials involving 392 patients.\n\n\n\nBecause past research has been mixed, doctors\' treatment guidelines mention the remedies, but don\'t necessarily give them a ringing endorsement, says author Alex Ford, M.D., a registrar of gastroenterology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\n\n\n"I suspect that filters down to the practitioners who don\'t believe they work, so they try something that\'s newer or a bit sexier," Dr. Ford says. "The problem with IBS is that it\'s a chronic medical condition and no drug has been shown to alter its natural history." Health.com: Should I be tested for IBS?\n\n\n\nThe study results are not surprising, says Joanne A.P. Wilson, M.D., a professor of medicine in the gastroenterology department at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n\n\nDr. Wilson adds that such treatments are best for patients with mild or moderate IBS. However, in her practice, she\'s found that prescription medications need to be used for severe cases that don\'t respond to these treatments. Health.com: Belly flab doubles mortality risk\n\n\n\nPrescription drugs that have been used to treat IBS include Amitiza, a drug for chronic constipation; Zelnorm, which was pulled from the market in 2007; and Lotronex, which was removed from the market because of potentially life-threatening side effects (although exceptions are now made for women with severe, diarrhea-prominent IBS who don\'t respond to other treatments).\n\n\n\nEnter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com', 'qa': [{'question': 'Is the cause of ibs known?', 'answers': ['exact', 'of', 'unknown,', 'remains unknown,', 'The exact']}, {'question': 'When did the study occur?', 'answers': ['25', '25 years']}, {'question': 'What percent of North Americans have ibs?', 'answers': ['10 to 15', 'About 10 to 15']}, {'question': 'What does the study analysis say works?', 'answers': ['Peppermint oil, soluble fiber, and antispasmodic drugs', 'Peppermint oil, soluble fiber, and antispasmodic drugs can indeed help people with irritable bowel syndrome,']}, {'question': 'What drugs are classified as antospasmodic?', 'answers': ['Lotronex,', 'hyoscine,', 'Amitiza,', 'Zelnorm,', 'that relax the smooth muscle in the gut and relieve cramping']}, {'question': 'Approximately how many people in North America have IBS?', 'answers': ['10 to 15 percent']}, {'question': 'What treatments work for ibs?', 'answers': ['Peppermint oil, soluble fiber, and antispasmodic drugs', 'including fiber supplements, probiotics, antidepressants, behavioral-based therapies, psychotherapy, food modification, acupuncture, and laxatives.']}]}
{'text': '(CNN) -- A former drug dealer was executed in Texas on Wednesday night for the murders of two reputed gang members -- 15 years to the day after the crime.\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas death row inmate Frank Moore says he acted in self-defense when he shot and killed two in 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrank Moore, 49, was pronounced dead at 7:21 p.m. ET, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Self-defense is not capital murder," Moore said before the lethal injection began, echoing his unsuccessful claims to the courts to prevent his execution.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoore did not deny firing the fatal shots outside a San Antonio bar but insisted he acted in self-defense and did not deserve to die.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoore was the second death row inmate to be executed in 2009. He spoke at length with CourtTVnews.com in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamuel Boyd and Patrick Clark were shot multiple times in the head and chest early in the morning of January 21, 1994, outside the Wheels of Joy bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n"They came with intentions to kill me," Moore said in the interview. "It was a do-or-die situation."\n\n\n\n\n\nBut no witnesses ever came forward at trial to corroborate Moore\'s self-defense claims. Prosecutors contended that Moore, a long-time gang member with a lengthy rap sheet dating back to his teens, shot the two in cold blood to assert his authority after a shoving match broke out in the bar, according to court records.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Bexar County jury convicted Moore and sentenced him to death, but his conviction was reversed in 1998 after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found error in the trial court\'s refusal to give the jury the option of convicting Moore of a lesser offense. Even so, Moore was convicted and sentenced to death at his second trial in 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoore insisted he acted in self-defense when he opened fire on Boyd, 23, and Clark, 15, at a bar near the housing projects where Moore admitted he sold crack cocaine and weapons.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it was not until 2006 that a private investigator, who once worked against Moore and his fellow gangsters, came forward with information that Moore said corroborated his self-defense claims.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarren Huel, a retired Navy Seal who was in charge of the private security firm that oversaw the projects, was the first peace officer on the scene, arriving about 45 minutes before the San Antonio Police Department, according to an affidavit.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring that time, Huel said he spoke with witnesses who reported that Boyd and Clark shot at Moore first from inside the car after trying to run him over, according to the affidavit.\n\n\n\n\n\nWitnesses also told Huel that they had seen the victims\' relatives remove their weapons from the car before police arrived, Huel stated in the affidavit.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Huel attempted to share the information with San Antonio Police, he says the officers told him to forget everything he had seen and learned, he said in an affidavit.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I was told that did not matter, as they already had Frank Moore, the murder weapon and an eyewitness," Huel stated in his affidavit. "I was told Moore was a dope dealer and had to go to jail."\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, three others have come forward claiming they witnessed the shootings, providing similar details, said Moore\'s lawyer, David Sergi.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Unfortunately, people from the street didn\'t come forward to testify at the time of the trial," he said. "The problem is, the law doesn\'t allow for a change of circumstances."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Texas State Attorney\'s Office argued that Moore\'s claims should be dismissed because the evidence had always been available, and was not the "newly discovered" evidence the law requires.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lower court sided with the state, prompting Moore to appeal to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. On Monday, the court declined to hear his claims, making the U.S. Supreme Court Moore\'s last chance for a reprieve.

"They\'ve already pulled some of the folks out of there, but they\'ve got a long way to go."\n\n\n\nAll 49 passengers aboard Continental Connection Flight 3407 died when the 74-seat Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 turboprop crashed into a home in Clarence Center, New York, on Thursday night. A 61-year-old man in the house died also, but his wife and daughter survived.\n\n\n\nFifteen bodies have been recovered, and efforts to identify the victims and conduct autopsies are under way, Erie County Health Commission Anthony Billittier said Saturday evening. A federal disaster mortuary team was called to assist local forensic officials.\n\n\n\nDespite reports from local authorities who said the plane hurtled toward the house from a sharp nosedive, Chealander said the current orientation of the plane indicates that it fell flat on its belly.\n\n\n\nThe Continental flight from Newark, New Jersey, operated by Colgan Air, crashed about 10:17 p.m. Thursday northeast of Buffalo Niagara International Airport.  Follow the plane\'s path »\n\n\n\nChealander said the recovery effort and the investigation have been hampered by freezing temperatures as authorities try to sift through the wreckage of the flight and the home it struck.

{'text': 'New York (CNN) -- President Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday by talking about war and the limits of nonviolence.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he also praised the peacemakers of the past and said the world can and should still strive for peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Let us reach for the world that ought to be," he told the 1,000-member audience at Oslo City Hall in Norway. "Clear-eyed, we can understand that there will be war, and still strive for peace."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nobel committee\'s choice of Obama as this year\'s laureate sparked debate, in part because he is a president waging two wars abroad.

The UN approved it, and over 50 countries are participating one way or another, so countries won\'t react negatively. Obama wanted to remind people, including those in his own party here in the U.S., that the Afghanistan war has a morally legitimate basis and that there are occasions in history where force is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: Are there any potential pitfalls to spending so much of the speech defending the war on moral grounds?\n\n\n\n\n\nZakaria: The great danger of moral certitude is that you get distracted from the practical issue of whether things are working. Are we creating a stable government? Are we being successful against the Taliban and al Qaeda? From Woodrow Wilson to Vietnam, the question of whether a military action is morally legitimate can overshadow whether it works.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: Does the speech give us any window into how Obama might conduct U.S. foreign policy going forward?\n\n\n\n\n\nZakaria: The Afghanistan speech last week and the Nobel speech are the two clearest statements of his worldview. He isn\'t making a broad statement like President Bush, when he vowed to end tyranny in the world. Obama says the U.S. is a force for good, but is engaging with the world and is trying to avoid open-ended commitments.\n\n\n\n\n\nObama wants the U.S. to play a world role that is progressive and idealistic, but remains aware of the practical limitations inherent in trying to operate in a messy world.', 'qa': [{'question': "what does Fareed Zakaria say about the president's speech?", 'answers': ['The', 'reflected his basic philosophy, which is why it worked so well.']}, {'question': 'What speeches are mentioned?', 'answers': ["Obama's acceptance speech", 'President Obama', 'Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech?']}, {'question': "what are the clearest statements of Obama's worldview?", 'answers': ['"Let us reach for the world that ought to be,"', '"Clear-eyed, we can understand that there will be war, and still strive for peace."', 'The Afghanistan speech last week and the Nobel speech']}, {'question': 'Whats the journalists name?', 'answers': ['Fareed Zakaria,']}]}

{'text': '(CNN) -- U.S. President Obama sent a direct message to Iran\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei weeks before this month\'s disputed election, Iranian sources said Wednesday.\n\n\n\nIran\'s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calls for an end to protests last week at Tehran University.\n\n\n\nThe letter requested dialogue and engagement between the two nations, the sources said.\n\n\n\nThe sources said that Khamenei has yet to reply to the letter but that nonetheless it "had set the negotiating table in order for both sides to sit around it after the election."\n\n\n\nThe White House refused to "get into the specifics of our different ways of communicating," a senior Obama administration official said.\n\n\n\n"We have indicated a willingness to talk for a long time and have sought to communicate with the Iranians in a variety of ways," the official said.\n\n\n\nKhamenei made an indirect reference to the letter in his sermon on Friday at Tehran University.\n\n\n\n"The U.S. president said that we were waiting for a day like this to see people on the street," the Iranian leader said. "Some people attributed these remarks to Obama, and then they write letters to say we\'re ready to have ties, that we respect the Islamic Republic, and on the other hand, they make such comments. Which one should we believe?"\n\n\n\nOne Iranian source said, "We thought President Obama would send congratulations to President Ahmadinejad," and before the election, his senior advisers prepared a response to the anticipated note, which never came.\n\n\n\nThe Iranian source said the election dispute is wasting time on the issue of starting U.S.-Iranian negotiations.  Watch how the reported letter is part of a new policy of engagement »\n\n\n\n"The longer it is delayed," the source said, "the less likely [U.S.-Iranian talks] will happen."\n\n\n\nAnother Iranian government official said there is still "no trust" between Iran and the United States.\n\n\n\nThe source said he is waiting for "real change" even though the Iranian government welcomed the change in tone of the Obama administration before the current election turmoil in Iran. The official went on to cite a recent gesture by Iran toward Obama: the release of journalist Roxana Saberi.\n\n\n\nThe official said Iran accepted Obama\'s assurances that she was not a spy and had allowed the Iranian citizen to leave the country.\n\n\n\nSince, under intense scrutiny amid growing concerns over Tehran\'s violent crackdown on street protests, Obama has sharpened his language on Iran.\n\n\n\n"The United States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, beatings and imprisonments of the last few days," Obama said Tuesday, adding that he strongly condemns "these unjust actions."\n\n\n\nHe has not spoken in support of Ahmadinejad or his main rival, Mir Hossein Moussavi, whose supporters have taken to the streets to protest the results of the June 12 election that gave Ahmadinejad a second term.\n\n\n\nObama\'s letter to Khamenei is in keeping with his publicly stated aim of engagement with Iran and his New Year\'s message in which he described a new way forward.\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration has "made it clear that any real dialogue -- multilateral or bilateral -- needed to be authoritative," according to the senior administration official.\n\n\n\nThe official noted that the Iranians have yet to respond to a diplomatic outreach made during talks on Iran\'s nuclear program April 8. At that time, the administration asked the European Union\'s international policy chief, Javier Solana, to invite Iran to new talks with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany.\n\n\n\nBut the administration\'s tack toward Iran may be changing, as senior officials in Washington said the Obama administration is seriously considering not extending further invitations to Iranian diplomats for July 4 celebrations overseas.

{'text': 'Los Angeles (CNN)  -- Keep debating whether video games are art if you wish. At E3, the world\'s biggest gaming expo, it\'s a closed question. Here, video games are definitely art -- and a gallery-style exhibit aims to prove it to as many people as care to look.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Into the Pixel," a juried art show now in its eighth year, opened on Tuesday, showcasing work that supporters say is finally receiving its just due in the sometimes-cloistered art world.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There actually is no line at all between the video-game artist and the fine-art world," said Nora Dolan, an independent curator who has worked at galleries including the Ansel Adams Museum in San Francisco and the Whitney Museum in New York and was one of the jurors for the show.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There\'s no difference to me. This is as high-quality an exhibit as could be."\n\n\n\n\n\nSeventeen images were selected for the show out of hundreds of submissions. After showing at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the exhibit will spend the next year traveling to festivals and conventions around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs may be expected, there were dragons and spaceships, creepy monsters and brave heroes depicted in the show. But other pieces might not be pegged as video-game images at all if not for the setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Oktonok Cay Cannery," by David Guertin from the game "Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One," is a rendering of a highly abstracted shipyard that wouldn\'t look out of place next to work by Salvador Dali.\n\n\n\n\n\n"The Pelican," by Andrew Kim from "Uncharted 3: Drake\'s Deception," is a detailed look at the interior of an empty and vaguely ominous East End London pub.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prints on display at the opening in the Los Angeles Convention Center were created for video games that range from massive hits from major companies to small, independent games. Some were touched up slightly for their gallery debut, but many are directly lifted from gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\nTyler Breon\'s entry, "Cronos Battle," from last year\'s "God of War III," depicts an enormous monster hulking over the game\'s main character, peering down at him with a look hovering somewhere between perplexed and annoyed.\n\n\n\n\n\nBreon, a senior character artist for Sony, had his first gallery showing at "Into the Pixel." Video-game art, like other emerging art forms, needed time to earn wider acceptance, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"You look at all kinds of media that were new -- anything that\'s new, people aren\'t really comfortable with initially," he said, citing the way comic-book art is now taken seriously, but only after decades of scorn. "I think the longer they\'re exposed to it, they come to be more comfortable with it."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe past year may have been a turning point in the art world\'s comfort with video games. The Smithsonian Institution announced that, in 2012, it will be opening "The Art of Video Games," an exhibition spanning four decades of gaming images.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, last month, the National Endowment for the Arts announced video games would join film, radio and other media that are eligible for government support.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There are signs that this is really happening," said Martin Rae, president of the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences which, along with the Entertainment Software Association, sponsors "Into the Pixel."\n\n\n\n\n\n"We now have a realization within the government that what we do is art," Rae said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRae compares video-game art to photography. In its infancy, art communities dismissed photo-taking as a simple act of point-and-shoot, merely copying an image that already existed.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I think we had the same thing here," he said. "But the public is catching up."\n\n\n\n\n\nBy showcasing the work in "Into the Pixel," Rae and others hope to speed that process.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Every time traditional fine arts people look at what we have in our industry, they immediately recognize that the artists within our industry are exceptional," he said.', 'qa': [{'question': "What is finally receiving it's just due?", 'answers': ['"Into the Pixel,"', 'video-game art', 'video games are art']}, {'question': 'What did the curator say about video game art?', 'answers': ['"There actually is no line at all between the video-game artist and the fine-art world,"']}, {'question': 'What did the curator say?', 'answers': ['"There actually is no line at all between the video-game artist and the fine-art world,"', '"There\'s no difference to me.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Will Smith\'s Hancock wasn\'t the first superhero with bad habits and a bad attitude. Hellboy, the protagonist of "Hellboy II: The Golden Army," has a bit of the devil in him: His skin is red; he has two shorn-off horns on his head, a gargantuan club fist and a long, slippery tail.\n\n\n\nRon Perlman returns in the title role in "Hellboy II: The Golden Army."\n\n\n\nHe also has a down-to-earth side: a fondness for Cuban cigars, Mexican beer, TV and candy. He has a short fuse and he\'d like a little appreciation for his efforts, please.\n\n\n\nHe deserves it, too.\n\n\n\nThis rank outsider isn\'t a billionaire like Bruce Wayne or Tony Stark. He\'s not even a scientist like Bruce Banner. He\'s more of a working stiff, a slugger with a gruff manner and a stogie in the side of his mouth -- but he wants to bat for the right team. (According to writer-artist Mike Mignola, the character was inspired by his father, a cabinetmaker.)\n\n\n\nHellboy -- or "Red" to his friends -- has switched studios since his 2004 big-screen debut, from Columbia to Universal. Not that it shows. Writer-director Guillermo del Toro is still pulling the strings, and the key creative personnel are all back, including Ron Perlman in the title role, Selma Blair as the pyrokinetic Liz (now Mrs. Hellboy), Doug Jones as the piscine Abe Sapien (the brains to Red\'s brawn), and -- behind the scenes -- cinematographer Guillermo Navarro, and art whizzes Stephen Scott and Peter Francis.\n\n\n\nBetween them, they conjure up one hell of a creature feature.\n\n\n\n"Hellboy II" boasts a dazzling multitude of imaginary beings: the deceptively delicate tooth fairies (so called because they eat bone, with a fondness for teeth in particular); the elfin king whose antlers grow out of his head to form a crown; the plantlike forest god that collapses into a strangely beautiful floral mulch right under the Brooklyn Bridge; the magnificent Angel of Death, an old crone who unfurls her wings to reveal a sparkling set of eyes (an avian variation on the creepiest creation in the acclaimed "Pan\'s Labyrinth," del Toro\'s last movie).\n\n\n\nThen there\'s the redoubtable Johann Kraus, an officious but in many ways admirable German who only exists as a vapor trail -- except when he\'s bottled up in an ingeniously modified, but still splendidly archaic, deep-sea diving suit.\n\n\n\nWhen a filmmaker can invest even a puff of smoke with so much chutzpah you know he\'s on to something. It\'s wonderful to see del Toro let his imagination run rampant like this. iReport.com: Did you see "Hellboy II"? Share your review\n\n\n\nThe plot concerns an ancient race that\'s determined to wage war on humanity, but it\'s secondary to del Toro\'s amazing characters.\n\n\n\nThe Mexican director\'s first Hollywood movies ("Mimic" and "Blade II") were far less distinctive than his Spanish-language films: "Cronos," "The Devil\'s Backbone" and "Pan\'s Labyrinth." You couldn\'t really call "Hellboy II" an advance on the latter -- "Pan\'s" was nominated for six Oscars and won three -- but it\'s obvious he relishes this material. It\'s pulpy and hammy and unashamedly lowbrow, and del Toro has the confidence and power to make it his own. The film feels very free, loose and (unusually for a special-effects picture) improvisational.\n\n\n\nAn outsize personality such as Perlman is in his element here. Even when the wisecracks fall short -- there are an awful lot of "ass" gags -- they are closer to the grubby, subversive impulses of the comic books than the over-hyped, market-tested, industrial-strength blockbuster adaptations Hollywood churns out.\n\n\n\nIt\'s not for nothing that the central tension running through this movie is Red\'s anarchic streak, his sometimes irresponsible need to be his own man in the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (the "X-Men"-like institution where he works) and in his marriage. Scratch the surface, and this is a film about love and loyalty, figuring out where your deepest bonds lie.\n\n\n\nHighbrows may damn "Hellboy II" as a "comic book movie," though even they would have to grant that its wonderful idiosyncrasies indicate brilliance. But it\'s more than that. Hellboy does so much growing up over the course of these 110 minutes, we may have to call him "Hellman" from now on.\n\n\n\nLet\'s hope Universal stays the course and gives us that opportunity. People as creative as del Toro and his gang need all the support we can give them.\n\n\n\n"Hellboy II: The Golden Army" is rated PG-13 and runs 110 minutes.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Back in 2006, volunteers with No More Deaths, a humanitarian organization dedicated to helping migrants along the Arizona-Mexico border, began hearing the same stories from many who had been in the custody of the U.S. Border Patrol.\n\n\n\n\n\nThwarted would-be unauthorized immigrants spoke of being denied water or food during their custody. Others said they were beaten.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organization started properly documenting these allegations, and the stories added up to nearly 13,000 testimonies whose results were released in a report this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe findings went beyond denial of food and water. Migrants held by the Border Patrol spoke of being exposed to extreme heat or cold, sleep deprivation, death threats, and psychological abuse such as blaring music with lyrics about migrants dying in the desert.\n\n\n\n\n\nA previous report by No More Deaths in 2008 raised the same concerns, but now the number of recorded cases point to a systematic problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n"By this point, the overwhelming weight of the corroborated evidence should eliminate any doubt that Border Patrol abuse is widespread," the report states.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Border Patrol responded with a statement highlighting the fact that respect for detainees is taught in training and consistently reinforced during an agent\'s career.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Mistreatment or agent misconduct will not be tolerated in any way," the statement said. "We appreciate the efforts of individuals to report concerns as soon as they arise and we will continue to cooperate fully with any effort to investigate allegations of agent misconduct or mistreatment of individuals."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interviews were conducted with migrants in Naco, Nogales and Agua Prieta, in Mexico\'s Sonora state who were in border patrol custody. Although No More Deaths conducted thousands of interviews, in places like Nogales they could only speak with a fraction of the migrants who crossed. This raised the issue of how representative their sample was, said Katerina Sinclair, a statistical consultant on the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in Naco, a smaller town, they were able to speak with enough migrants to have a representative sample. So the report stays away from making conclusions about percentages except for the subset of interviewees from Naco. But despite the difficulties with such an ambitious project, the authors say that the numbers on their own are cause for concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome 2,981 people reported they were denied food, and more than 11,000 said they were given insufficient food by the Border Patrol, the report states.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report found that 863 people, many of whom were already dehydrated, were denied water.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were nearly 6,000 cases of overcrowding reported, and almost 3,000 people had at least some personal belongings not returned, the report states.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, 869 people -- including 17 children and 41 teenagers -- reported that they were split from their families and deported separately.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo More Deaths also recorded instances of sleep deprivation, death threats, and the forced holding of strenuous positions.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There\'s no question that there is systematic abuse of people in Border Patrol custody," Danielle Alvarado, one of the report\'s authors, told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the research focused on migrants in the Arizona border area, the findings are consistent with reports from Border Patrol sectors across the country, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"This systematic abuse must be confronted aggressively at the institutional level, not denied or dismissed as a series of aberrational incidents attributable to a few rogue agents," the report states.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its statement, the Border Patrol responded that, "on a daily basis, agents make every effort to ensure that people in our custody are given food, water, and medical attention as needed."\n\n\n\n\n\n"The sad reality is that between what they say on paper and the day-to-day reality there is a big disconnect," Alvarado said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrandon Judd, president of Local 2544, the Tucson branch of the National Border Patrol Council, said that it is No More Deaths\' report that is disconnected from reality.\n\n\n\n\n\nBorder patrol agents are law-abiding citizens who believe in accountability, he said. "If these allegations are true, these are crimes," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 3,000 agents in the Tucson Sector of the Border Patrol, Judd said, and one complaint every two weeks would be considered a lot. Agents also police themselves, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I can tell you that our agents are the ones who report mistreatment if they see it," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was skeptical about the types of questions that were asked and the credibility of the interviewees who were freshly repatriated.\n\n\n\n\n\n"There\'s some glaring weaknesses in the story," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Sinclair said that care was taken to make sure that all conclusions were drawn from the Naco sample, which also happened to report the lowest rate of incidents. The questions were also phrased in a way to give credit to the Border Patrol where due.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We gave them every benefit of the doubt," she said. But their research shows that "it only gets worse from here."\n\n\n\n\n\n"It just doesn\'t ring true," Judd said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reports of abuses come as the number of apprehensions along the border has decreased. Increased border enforcement and a slow economic recovery in the United States have reduced the amount of illegal traffic across the border.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, No More Deaths reported, the demographics of those being deported have changed. A number of the migrants they interviewed were older and had been in the United States longer. One sample of 100 migrants revealed an average of 14.4 years of living in the United States before deportation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn light of its report, its authors argue for legally enforceable standards, and a tougher oversight mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom October of last year to the present, about 115,000 migrants were apprehended by the Border Patrol\'s Tucson Sector.', 'qa': [{'question': 'What was the number of migrants', 'answers': ['about 115,000', '115,000']}, {'question': 'Who spoke with the migrants?', 'answers': ['No More Deaths', 'No More Deaths,', 'volunteers']}, {'question': 'What was alleged', 'answers': ['denied water or food during their custody.', 'unauthorized immigrants spoke of being denied water or food during their custody.

{'text': 'Washington (CNN) -- Idaho on Wednesday became the first state to pass a law saying no thanks to part of President Obama\'s health care proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Idaho Health Care Freedom Act says in part, "every person within the state of Idaho is and shall be free to choose or decline to choose any mode of securing health care services without penalty or threat of penalty."\n\n\n\n\n\nGov. C.L. "Butch" Otter, a Republican, said Wednesday he signed it because he believes any health care laws should ensure people are "treated as an individual, rather than as an amorphous mass whose only purpose in this world is to obey federal mandates."\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral other states may follow suit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe governor of Virginia is expected to sign a bill passed in his state last week, and according to American Legislative Exchange Council, similar proposals have made it through one chamber of the legislatures in Missouri, Oklahoma and Tennessee. While such bills have recently failed in six states, 22 additional states have seen proposals introduced.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese state laws would directly conflict with the national health care bill that Democrats are trying to pass, which includes a requirement that all individuals get health coverage or face a tax penalty.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral legal analysts said if Congress enacts a national health care law, it would supersede any state laws written to block them.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I think most of the states that are passing these laws understand that they can\'t trump federal law with state law," said Professor Jonathan Siegel at George Washington University Law School. "But what they get out of it is symbolic effect. They\'re sending a message to the federal politicians that they don\'t like the health care mandate."\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch state laws might not be the only legal challenge to Democratic health care legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorida Attorney General Bill McCollum, a Republican, on Tuesday sent a letter to the other 49 state attorneys general, asking them to join him "in preparing a legal challenge to the constitutionality of whatever individual mandate provision emerges, immediately upon the legislation becoming law."\n\n\n\n\n\nStates have previously challenged federal laws and regulations in areas aside from health care.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive states have passed a Firearms Freedom Act, according to firearmsfreedomact.com, including Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah. The law declares that any guns that are manufactured and kept in-state are not subject to federal gun laws passed by Congress under interstate commerce authority, because the guns never crossed state lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of states have also passed laws trying to wrest more control from Washington over issues such as how public lands are used or how a state\'s National Guard forces are deployed overseas, according to the 10th Amendment Center, which advocates for states\' rights.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile such laws may face an uphill path in court, supporters describe them as a sign of public opinion, which can still have impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey point to last year\'s announcement of federal policy on medicinal marijuana, after 14 states passed laws to allow its use. While federal drug law makes no exception to allow medicinal use of marijuana, Attorney General Eric Holder said in October that prosecuting the use of medicinal marijuana users wouldn\'t be a priority.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the Justice Department would instead "effectively focus our resources on serious drug traffickers, while taking into account state and local laws."\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Brian Todd and Eric Weisbrod contributed to this report.', 'qa': [{'question': 'what amount of states have seen proposals', 'answers': ['22']}, {'question': 'How many colleagues received letters from Florida attorny general?', 'answers': ['49']}, {'question': 'What law passed Idaho ?', 'answers': ['Health Care Freedom Act', 'The', 'Gov.

{'text': '(Mental Floss) -- We all know about the Confederate states leaving the Union. But that was far from the only secessionist movement in American history. Here are some rebellious regions you won\'t find in too many history books.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map shows some rebellious regions that have tried to seceed from the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. The Kingdom of Beaver Island\n\n\n\n\n\nBeaver Island, a small island in Lake Michigan, became the home of Mormon leader James Strang and his followers -- called Strangites -- in 1848. Two years later, Strang declared himself king of the church -- complete with crown, scepter, robe, and a harem of 15 wives.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, most of the island\'s inhabitants were his followers, so he essentially became King of Beaver Island. The power got to his head, and he began forcing his rule onto the non-believers, causing some violence between the two factions.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1856, the USS Michigan pulled into the harbor and invited Strang aboard. As he was walking towards the ship, he was shot in the back by disgruntled followers, who then ran up the gangplank and escaped. Adding to the mysterious circumstances, the assassins were set ashore on nearby Mackinac Island and never charged for their crime.\n\n\n\n\n\nShortly after the assassination, angry mobs from surrounding islands eventually forced the Strangites from their homes, thus ending the short-lived Kingdom of Beaver Island.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The state of Superior\n\n\n\n\n\nConcern over a perceived lack of interest from the Michigan state government, the people of the Upper Peninsula (U.P.), affectionately known as "Yoopers," have been trying to secede and form the State of Superior since as far back as 1897.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe movement gained momentum after 1957 when a bridge connecting the U.P. region to Lower Michigan made it easier for southern "Trolls" (people who live "below the bridge") and Yoopers to mingle. This animosity continued into the mid-1980s, when 20,000 signatures were collected and submitted to the state for a secession request.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the number was shy of the 36,000 required, and the request subsequently denied. The secessionist drive lives on today, as numerous grassroots organizations are trying to muster support for another official attempt at an independent U.P. Until that day comes, though, the Yoopers and Trolls will just have to try to get along.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The Great Republic of Rough and Ready\n\n\n\n\n\nRough and Ready, California, was a mining town founded in 1849 by the Rough and Ready Company of Wisconsin. As the town\'s population rapidly exploded to 3,000, lawlessness was on the rise -- and the U.S. government was not much help squelching the rampant crime. Mental Floss: Three controversial maps\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, a new federal tax on mining operations added fuel to the region\'s civil unrest. Seeing little support from Washington, on April 7, 1850, the townspeople voted to secede from the Union.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut just three months later, as the Fourth of July approached, The Great Republic of Rough and Ready wanted to have a celebration (which seems odd considering they were no longer technically Americans). When nearby Nevada City wouldn\'t sell liquor to "foreign miners," it was decided that maybe America wasn\'t so bad after all. The townspeople voted themselves back into the Union on the very same day and the party went off as planned.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. The Conch Republic\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the early-1980s, the U.S. Border Patrol set up a checkpoint at the entrance to the Florida Keys in an effort to stop illegal drugs and immigrants. The time to check everyone\'s identification at the checkpoint resulted in a 20-mile traffic jam that turned tourists away, thus damaging the economy in the Keys.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter numerous legal attempts to have the checkpoint removed, on April 23, 1982, Key West mayor Dennis Wardlow declared the Florida Keys were seceding from the Union.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoments later, now-Prime Minister Wardlow symbolically declared war on the U.S. by breaking a stale piece of Cuban bread over the head of a man dressed in a U.S. Navy uniform. One minute later, Wardlow turned to the Admiral in charge of the U.S. Naval Base at Key West and surrendered, thus ending the Conch Republic\'s Civil Rebellion. He then immediately asked for $1 billion in federal aid to help rebuild his war-torn nation\'s economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile officially the Republic only existed for one minute, the tongue-in-cheek spirit of the rebellion lives on. Today you can buy Conch Republic citizen and diplomatic passports (both of which have been used for international travel, though they are not intended to be official documents) and even an official flag of the republic (complete with the awesome motto, "We seceded where others failed"). The community has even minted a series of limited edition one-conch dollar coins that can be used as legal tender while in the Keys.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. The State of Absaroka\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling that the Democratic southern half of Wyoming was not working in conjunction with the rest of the state, a secessionist movement was launched by northern Republicans in 1939 to create a new state that would better serve its more conservative population.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis state, Absaroka -- so named after the nearby mountain range -- was to be made up of northern Wyoming, southeast Montana, and the western region of South Dakota. While the secessionist movement was never very large or pursued through legal channels, that didn\'t stop A. R. Swickard, the street commissioner of Sheridan, Wyoming, from appointing himself governor of the "state."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe movement went so far as to press Absaroka license plates and crown a Miss Absaroka beauty queen. Absaroka could even brag about a visit from a foreign dignitary, King Haakon VII of Norway (though he was officially visiting Wyoming and just happened to be in Absaroka).\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite all of the hoopla, the state never came to be, and now, so many years later, the intent of the secessionist movement is in question. Some believe there was a genuine attempt to create a new state, while others say it was just a fun way for cowboys to distract themselves during tough economic times.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. The State of Jefferson\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthern California and southern Oregon have been trying to merge since 1852. The attempts have been met with mixed results, though the "State of Jefferson" movement of 1941 came closest to making it happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe region felt it was being ignored by their respective state legislatures, so in response the people created the "State of Jefferson Citizen\'s Committee" to explore the possibilities of secession. The group began stopping cars on Highway 99 to hand out the state\'s "Proclamation of Independence," a pamphlet outlining the grievances they held and the solutions they proposed.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo help rally their cause, they developed a state flag made up of a gold miner\'s pan with two black X\'s inside, representing the double-cross they felt the Oregon and California state governments had pulled. Mental Floss: Thomas Jefferson\n\n\n\n\n\nOn December 4, 1941, Judge John Childs was elected governor of Jefferson in the state\'s temporary capital of Yreka, California. The event was filmed by numerous newsreel companies who were set to air the footage during the week of December 8.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory had other plans, as the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor the day before the big premiere. Driven by a sense of national obligation, the Jefferson secession was put aside and never really regained momentum. While the official movement might have died out, the residents of this region still hold the concept in their hearts, with many identifying themselves even today as the population of the great state of Jefferson.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. The McDonald Territory\n\n\n\n\n\nNoel, Missouri, located in McDonald County in the far southwest corner of the Show Me State, has been a popular tourist destination for many years. Therefore, when the Missouri State Highway Commission left Noel off their annual "Family Vacationland" map in 1961, the region was not happy pleased.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo display their dissatisfaction, McDonald County drew up papers of secession and presented them to the state legislature, declaring itself the independent McDonald Territory. The county went so far as to elect officials, form a territorial militia, and even printed up visas that were issued to visitors so they could travel throughout the territory.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most lasting impression were the thousands of McDonald Territory stamps that were printed and sold throughout the area. While most agree that the secession was done purely for publicity, the state of Missouri wasn\'t necessarily happy about the type of publicity it was garnering.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo in order to end this mock rebellion, the state declared that state employee retirement pension payments would be suspended for McDonald County, all current state employees would be fired, and all state funding would be withheld. Needless to say, McDonald Territory surrendered and returned to being simply McDonald County, Missouri, once again.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here\'s one more secessionist movement that\'s been in the news this year. From 1995 to 2002 (except for a few months in 2000), Alaska\'s First Dude Todd Palin was a member of the Alaska Independence Party. Fellow Mental Floss writer Jeff Fleischer has the story on the AIP:\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Alaska\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, a well-organized separatist movement has campaigned to turn America\'s largest state into its own nation. The bitterness dates back to 1958, when Alaska\'s citizens were given a simple yes-or-no vote on statehood.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany Alaskans felt they were denied more options on the issue, prompting a land developer named Joe Vogler to organize a re-vote that would offer Alaskans four possibilities -- remain a territory, become a state, take commonwealth status, or become a separate nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the vote as his platform, Vogler ran for governor in 1974 -- and soon made a habit of it. With colorful slogans such as, "I\'m an Alaskan, not an American. I\'ve got no use for America or her damned institutions," Vogler spearheaded the Alaskan Independence Party (AIP), and his campaign has twice topped 5 percent of the vote.  Mental Floss: Nine modern-day independence movements\n\n\n\n\n\nMore surprisingly, former U.S. interior secretary Wally Hickel got elected governor on the AIP ticket in 1990. Unfortunately for the party, Hickel only ran on the ticket because he lost the Republican primary. Never a supporter of the plebiscite idea, Hickel left the AIP and rejoined the Republicans in 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the AIP continues to draw about 4 percent of voters statewide. And in 2006, Alaska took part in the first-ever North American Secessionist Convention, joining other groups from Vermont, Hawaii, and the South. As for Vogler, he was murdered in 1993 -- reportedly the result of an argument over a business deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a brighter note, honoring his wish to never be buried in U.S. soil, Vogler was laid to rest in Canada\'s Yukon Territory.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com', 'qa': [{'question': 'who are forced to get along in Michigan?', 'answers': ['Yoopers and Trolls']}, {'question': 'What did the Key West mayor do?', 'answers': ['declared the Florida', 'were seceding', 'were seceding from the Union.']}, {'question': 'Who does he lead?', 'answers': ["most of the island's inhabitants", 'his followers', 'called Strangites']}, {'question': 'who  named himself king of Beaver Island?', 'answers': ['Strang', 'James Strang']}, {'question': 'What did James Strang name himself?', 'answers': ['king of the church', 'Strangites']}, {'question': 'who  declared Florida Keys were seceding from Union in 1982?', 'answers': ['West mayor Dennis Wardlow']}]}

{'text': '(CNN) -- If an e-mail popped up in your inbox promising a house for $100, you\'d expect to see it sent from a guy in Nigeria asking you to wire him several thousand dollars first.\n\n\n\nZeb Smith lies on his front lawn and spends a quiet afternoon with his neighbors.\n\n\n\nBut this depressed housing market dream is real. And Detroit, Michigan, artist Jon Brumit and his wife, Sarah, are living it.\n\n\n\nThe couple never counted on owning a home.\n\n\n\n"It\'s not that we have a little money," Jon Brumit said, laughing. "I\'m saying we have no money."\n\n\n\nBut the couple began entertaining the idea of a permanent nest when their friends Mitch Cope and Gina Reichert, also artists, started taking advantage of foreclosures in the city, where the average home price dipped to $11,533 in April, according to the Detroit Association of Realtors.\n\n\n\nDragging down the average are homes that are long abandoned or foreclosed on that are selling for pennies on the dollar. Detroit already had the lowest market value houses in Michigan before the latest rounds of job losses at GM and other huge employers, market analysts say.\n\n\n\n"Those artists are doing a good thing; they are at least helping to stabilize neighborhoods that would be all but lost," said Mike Shedlock, an investment adviser who blogs frequently about Detroit\'s economy.\n\n\n\nFor less than a few thousand dollars, Cope and Reichert snapped up a dilapidated bungalow in a north Detroit neighborhood called "BanglaTown," for its unexpected mix of Bangladeshis, African-Americans, Polish and Ukrainians and the occasional shady character.\n\n\n\nScrappers had cleaned the house to the bone. The copper had been stolen; the electrical wiring was stripped.\n\n\n\nBut no matter. Here was a chance for Cope and Reichert, who run a popular Detroit art store, to rehabilitate the 1920s brick house into a bastion of energy savings, with solar panels, LED lights, recycled wood and high-end insulated windows.\n\n\n\nThey\'re installing a security system that exemplifies elegant efficiency with hurricane-proof windows and steel doors replacing burglar bars. They are also experimenting with running their air-conditioning on a car battery.\n\n\n\nThe project became known as the Power House. Cope and Reichert wanted to create a central place to power homes nearby and, in turn, revive a neighborhood\'s sense of community.\n\n\n\nThe trick was getting their friends not only to cheer the concept but invest in it by moving next door.\n\n\n\n"It was much easier than we thought it might be," Cope said. "We told everyone that Detroit is an interesting city to work in as an artist, and the neighborhood is diverse. But, really, it came down to money."\n\n\n\n"I kept telling Mitch, \'Wow those are an awesome, ridiculously good deals but if you find anything that\'s less, let me know," Brumit said. "Like, if something comes along for next to nothing, cool."\n\n\n\nA few weeks later, Cope e-mailed Brumit a photo of an abandoned home on his block. Its windows were boarded up and plywood was nailed across the front door. The huge hole in the roof was courtesy of the fire department. A neighbor said the house had been set on fire -- twice.\n\n\n\nPricetag: $100. Brumit called a real estate agent with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, who confirmed that bids on the foreclosed property started at $95 for the property, $5 for the house. There were no back taxes -- no one seemed to be sure who once owned the house, it had been empty for so long, Brumit said.\n\n\n\nCope, also a designer and builder, and an inspector did a walk-through.\n\n\n\n"Inspection was fine and Mitch told me the foundation was good," Brumit said. "He just said, \'If you didn\'t mind scraping some peeling paint, doing some surface treatments, putting in new utilities, windows and repairing the roof ... this could be pretty interesting.\'"\n\n\n\nNow, when he\'s not hauling loads of rubble away or knocking out walls to create a single, open studio space, Brumit\'s searching Craigslist for a furnace. In exchange for designing the business Web site of a local barn recycler, he\'s getting materials to turn that hole in his roof into a skylight.\n\n\n\n"I saw it as a project," the artist said. "I\'m a builder. I\'ve been building skateboards since I was 12."\n\n\n\nSkateboards are one thing. Rebuilding homes where the plumbing has been ripped out or the cabinets destroyed in a fit by an upset foreclosed homeowner is another. Michigan housing authorities acknowledge that there\'s little incentive for people who aren\'t quite as handy as Brumit.\n\n\n\nIn two weeks, the state will begin offering $25,000 to anyone who buys a home, as long as they pay 1 percent of the total cost and live in it.  Landlords or speculators aren\'t eligible.\n\n\n\nPart of a $263 million grant given to Michigan and other states under 2008\'s Housing and Economic Recovery Act, the funds are intended to help buyers bring trashed properties up to code, according to Mary Townley, a director with the Michigan State Housing Development Authority.\n\n\n\nShe and other housing officials CNN spoke with said Michigan\'s economy has some extremely frustrating woes. A report from the nonprofit think tank Brookings Institution said Detroit had the lowest performing economy out of 100 U.S. cities it analyzed -- scoring the worst in unemployment and average wages, the highest foreclosure rates and the lowest market value homes.\n\n\n\nThe artists in BanglaTown are careful to say they are not looking to change a city. Their goal is simply to improve a neighborhood, one house at a time.\n\n\n\nNew neighbors, freelance photographer Corine Vermeulen-Smith and her husband Zeb Smith, a designer, are always checking out www.freecycle.com, where a stainless steel kitchen sink can be bought for $65.\n\n\n\nThe Smiths bought their 660-square-foot home for $549.99 from Cope and Reichert, who originally purchased the foreclosed home for $500. "We knew the property, we knew it had been sitting there empty for at least a year, and it had been trashed," Vermeulen-Smith said. "But we wanted to own a home."\n\n\n\nAll the copper in their "micro-home" had been ripped out, as well as every electrical outlet, Vermeulen-Smith said. Trash had to be hauled out in several loads.\n\n\n\n"You have to get over that fear that the house had that history, that you\'re going to be a victim of a crime or something," she said. "Crime is everywhere. My husband and I have lived in the city for a long time; we know that people look out for each other here. We don\'t have that kind of fear."\n\n\n\nCareful not to entice thieves again, the Smiths replaced the copper with plastic. They are considering taking the home completely off the grid by installing a mini-wind turbine, but for now they are happy to put in the basics.\n\n\n\nA bathtub from Habitat for Humanity cost them $100. And Zeb Smith, who works at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, brings home wood the museum would otherwise toss when installations close.\n\n\n\n"This is, for us, very exciting to believe that we could totally reinvent a space," she said, "and prove that having a home isn\'t about having money."', 'qa': [{'question': 'How much did artists pay for a trashed house?', 'answers': ['$100,', '$100.']}, {'question': 'who bought the house', 'answers': ['Jon Brumit and his wife, Sarah,']}, {'question': 'how much did the house cost', 'answers': ['$100,', '$100.']}, {'question': 'Have other artists ever bought houses in the same neighborhood?', 'answers': ['The couple never counted on owning a home.', 'started taking advantage of foreclosures in the city,', 'their friends Mitch Cope and Gina Reichert, also']}, {'question': 'chamo deja la marisquera Woman, two men allegedly posed as federal agents in home invasion', 'answers': ['Jon Brumit', 'Michigan,']}]}

"Can you ever imagine a scenario where you might one day get back together?"\n\n\n\n\n\n"I\'m way too old for him now," joked Richards, who turned 40 this year. "I\'m way past his age range."\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actress and mother of three is a guest on Thursday\'s "Piers Morgan Tonight." Richards is also a first-time author. Her new book, "The Real Girl Next Door," was released this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nRichards told Morgan that she and Sheen have been split up for six years. The couple\'s divorce was finalized in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\n"When we fell in love," Richards said, "he had been sober for three years. He was getting his life back together. He had just gotten a job on \'Spin City.\' And I really admired his strength and courage for overcoming addiction, and being so humble about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n"And that\'s what attracted me to him. So the Charlie that some of you have seen over the last six months is not the person that I met and married."\n\n\n\n\n\nRichards went on to say that Sheen was "amazing" when they first met. "He was so humbled and sweet, and charming and funny. And had such a great heart, and very honest. And we just had a very deep connection."\n\n\n\n\n\nMorgan asked Richards about her take on "the recent circus of Charlie\'s life."\n\n\n\n\n\n"From the beginning of it I was very worried," she said. "And it made me sad to see him that way. And so I was concerned. I was concerned for our children."\n\n\n\n\n\nRichards said that, in dealing with Sheen, the couple\'s two daughters -- Sam, 7, and Lola, 6 -- remain her priority.\n\n\n\n\n\n"We\'ll always have a bond with our daughters," she said. "And I wish nothing but the best for him."\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Morgan asked Richards what her wish for her ex-husband was, the actress said she wants him to be healthy and there for his kids and himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n"He\'s a survivor," said Richards. "If anyone can pick themselves up, make a huge comeback, it\'s Charlie."\n\n\n\n\n\nMorgan asked, what is the weirdest rumor she\'d ever heard about herself?\n\n\n\n\n\n"Well, this isn\'t that hurtful, but it\'s weird -- that I used to be a hooker. I used to be a Heidi Fleiss girl. I heard that rumor," Richards answered.\n\n\n\n\n\n"If anyone would know, it would be Charlie," said Richards, referring to Sheen\'s well-documented testimony in Fleiss\' 1995 trial that he had spent over $50,000 on 27 hookers.\n\n\n\n\n\nRichards, who is single, said of dating: "The qualities that I look for now are different than prior to getting married and having kids.\n\n\n\n\n\n"I find myself very attracted to men who have children. And I think one of the sexiest qualities in a man is seeing a man great with kids."\n\n\n\n\n\nRichards called motherhood her greatest achievement. "I love being a mother more than anything. And I get so much fulfillment and joy with my children."\n\n\n\n\n\nRichards opened up about her recent adoption of a baby girl, whom she named Eloise Joni Richards.\n\n\n\n\n\n"She\'s amazing," Richards said.

{'text': '(Budget Travel) -- Last October, more than 40 people followed signs depicting a skull and crossbones, with a knife and fork in place of the bones, to a secluded Bavarian-style hunting lodge 30 minutes north of St. Louis.\n\n\n\nAn Entre dinner party was hosted in a Missouri hunting lodge.\n\n\n\nThe attendees didn\'t have any idea where they were headed or what to expect. All they knew was that they were in for a five-course meal courtesy of John-Jack, an undercover chef who\'d invited each of them via a top-secret e-mail to the latest of what he calls his Entre dinner parties.\n\n\n\nGuests arrived to a bluegrass band jamming in a room decorated with deer antlers. As a fire crackled in the massive stone fireplace, they dined on wild-elk medallions, home-cured bacon, grapefruit confit, and butternut squash ice cream -- and toasted their good fortune with pumpkin ale from nearby microbrewery Schlafly.\n\n\n\nWelcome to the world of underground supper clubs. Getting a reservation requires a little detective work, but once in, you may never go back to eating out the old-school way again. The idea behind these dinners is to let talented chefs work their whisks in an affordable, relaxed setting.\n\n\n\nAnd since they\'re often operating out of their own kitchens, without a license to serve the public, these cooks have to keep the locales, and their own identities, under wraps. Budget Travel:  The utterly random dinner party\n\n\n\n"The trend started in food-centric cities like San Francisco, but in the last year, groups have been popping up across the country," says Jenn Garbee, author of "Secret Suppers," which spotlights some of the more than 80 clubs now up and running in the U.S.\n\n\n\nOne such is Guerrilla Cuisine, founded by an incognito cook in Charleston, South Carolina, who uses the alias Jimihatt and wears a ninja mask at his gatherings. As at many clubs, diners must submit their reservations weeks in advance on Jimihatt\'s Web site and then wait for an e-mail with directions to the hush-hush locale.\n\n\n\nBased on his track record, you won\'t be disappointed: The bearded Jimihatt and his rotating crew of sous-chefs have served secret, Southern-style suppers (andouille sausage gumbo, Cajun smoked chicken, chocolate beignets) in galleries, wineries, even a grocery store. Budget Travel: Haute diners\n\n\n\nJimihatt now has a little friendly competition from an Atlanta cook named Lady Rogue. Her RogueApron shindigs each have a different theme. At a recent event, a Great Depression-style repast in Lang-Carson Park, guests stood in a soup line for pancetta minestrone with porcini mushrooms, and lemongrass-spiked corn broth. Then they divided into teams for an impromptu game of Wiffle ball.\n\n\n\n"Our goal," Lady Rogue says, "is to make dining more inclusive and to have strangers connect over food. What better way to meet people?"\n\n\n\nFor those hoping to break bread with their own buddies, there\'s 12B in Vancouver. To keep operations simple, its mastermind, Chef Todd, hosts the six-course dinners in his own apartment, hence the name. And unlike most supper clubs, 12B cooks only for groups of friends (up to 12 at a time). Budget Travel: Pay-what-you-like restaurants\n\n\n\n"Even after working 16-hour days, I would sit at home and think, \'I\'ve got to find a way to feed more people,\'" Chef Todd says. Money isn\'t the incentive. His minimum-donation fee of $50 just covers costs for a feast (stuffed artichoke hearts, five-mushroom ravioli, butter-poached scallops served with BBQ pulled pork) that would average twice as much in a restaurant.\n\n\n\nBut as Chef Todd will attest, these clubs are less about saving and more about spending a night eating exceptionally well in the unlikeliest of places, whether a cozy lodge straight out of a fairy tale or a humble living room.\n\n\n\nSupper Clubs\n\n\n\nEntre, St. Louis, Missouri, http://danssouslaterre.com/, five-course meal from $45, including a wine pairing with each course\n\n\n\nGuerrilla Cuisine, Charleston, South Carolina, http://guerrillacuisine.com/, six-course meal from $50, BYOB\n\n\n\nRogueApron, Atlanta, Georgia, http://rogueapron.wordpress.com/, three-course meal $20, including wine or beer pairings with each course\n\n\n\n12B, Vancouver, B.C., 12breservations@gmail.com, six-course meal from $50, BYOB\n\n\n\nGet the best travel deals and tips emailed to you FREE - CLICK HERE!\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2009 Newsweek Budget Travel, Inc., all rights reserved.\n\n\n\nNote: This story was accurate when it was published.

{'text': '(CNN) -- A Democratic congressman from Mississippi plans to hold a hearing into how millions of dollars worth of supplies meant for Gulf Coast hurricane survivors ended up being given away as surplus property.\n\n\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson says he\'ll hold a hearing into how supplies for Katrina victims were diverted.\n\n\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, called the situation "a debacle."\n\n\n\nIn June, CNN revealed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had warehoused $85 million worth of household goods for two years before giving them away to federal agencies and 16 states. But Thompson said there is still a great need for basic supplies in Mississippi.\n\n\n\n"We just think that FEMA needs to come and tell the committee how such a debacle could occur, and in the process, what are they going to do to assure Congress and the taxpaying public that it will never happen again," Thompson said.\n\n\n\nThe household goods were meant to help Gulf Coast households rebuild. But they sat in FEMA warehouses for two years before the agency declared them surplus property and gave them away in February.\n\n\n\nThe state of Louisiana had not asked for any of the supplies, prompting outrage there after the original CNN report. Since then, the state has taken steps to claim some of the stockpiles and distribute them to groups working to resettle victims of Hurricane Katrina, the 2005 storm that flooded New Orleans and ravaged the Mississippi Gulf Coast.\n\n\n\nMississippi took the supplies it was offered but did not give them to Katrina victims. Instead, as CNN reported this week, the state distributed them to prisons, volunteer fire departments, colleges and other state agencies.\n\n\n\nThompson said he was stunned at how Mississippi officials made "a mockery of the whole process."\n\n\n\n"I\'m disappointed that my state decided that prisoners had a higher priority than Katrina victims and has made no effort to correct it even when this mistake was made," he said.\n\n\n\n"Any time items intended for victims of Katrina end up in the hands of the Department of Corrections or state employees, then clearly, Mississippi dropped the ball."  Watch victims tell why they need the items »\n\n\n\nThompson said his committee would "ask all the tough questions" and demand any documents associated with the matter.\n\n\n\n"So we are prepared, if necessary, to put those officials under oath," he said. "We are prepared if necessary to subpoena any and all documents relative to this situation."\n\n\n\nFEMA spokesman Marty Bahamonde said the agency welcomed any congressional hearing.\n\n\n\n"We always make ourselves available to answer the questions. That\'s something we are always ready to do," he said.\n\n\n\nFEMA said it was costing more than $1 million a year to store the supplies, but officials have not been able to answer why the agency didn\'t get the supplies to Katrina victims. FEMA said the agency has launched an internal probe into the issue.\n\n\n\nJim Marler, director of Mississippi\'s surplus agency, failed to return repeated phone calls over several months to explain what happened there. But spokeswoman Kym Wiggins said the agency was not told the items were still needed -- a statement that didn\'t sit well with groups working to rebuild the stricken coast.\n\n\n\nBill Stallworth, executive director of the Hope Coordination Center in Biloxi, said he and other community leaders would have begged for the FEMA stockpiles had they known they were available.\n\n\n\n"When I hear people stand up and just beat their chest and say we\'ve got everything under control, that\'s when I just want to slap them upside the head and say, \'Get a grip, get a life,\' " said Stallworth, also a Biloxi city councilman.\n\n\n\nIf you have a story tip, e-mail SIU.TIPS@CNN.com', 'qa': [{'question': 'what did fema hold', 'answers': ['$85 million worth of household goods', 'a hearing']}, {'question': 'How much was the supplies worth that FEMA held for two years?', 'answers': ['$85 million']}, {'question': 'Who wants  FEMA to explain giveaway of hurricane supplies?', 'answers': ['Bennie Thompson', "Jim Marler, director of Mississippi's surplus agency,"]}, {'question': 'who is Bennie Thompson?', 'answers': ['Democratic', 'chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security,', 'Rep.', 'A', 'congressman from Mississippi']}, {'question': 'goods given to who', 'answers': ['Katrina victims', 'Gulf Coast households']}, {'question': 'who wants fema to explain', 'answers': ['Bennie Thompson', 'Thompson']}, {'question': "What state didn't give the goods it received to hurricane victims?", 'answers': ['of Louisiana', 'Mississippi', 'The']}]}

But he did say Thomas spanked him with a belt on several occasions, the newspaper reported, and that the paddlings took place inside a jury room, in the small office and at a Mobile, Alabama, fraternity house.\n\n\n\nAnother man testified that after he was charged with kidnapping and robbery in 2002, Thomas visited him in jail and urged the man to let Thomas decide the case instead of a jury, according to the Press-Register. Thomas convicted him of lesser charges, he testified, and sentenced him to a 90-day boot camp. He said Thomas also beat him with a belt on his bare buttocks about a dozen times at the courthouse, the newspaper reported. Neither man was identified.\n\n\n\n"All of them [the alleged victims] were given preferential treatment at some point," Nicki Patterson, chief assistant district attorney for Mobile County, said earlier this month.

{'text': '(CNN) -- Explorer Dennis Schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near Greenland.\n\nFishermen pass by Greenland\'s Ilulissat fjord in this September 2004 picture.\n\nSuch a discovery would usually elicit curiosity, even wonder perhaps, but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer.\n\nThe island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to Greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier. But such a large amount of ice melted, it revealed the distinct island.\n\n"I very quickly realized two things," he told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year. "One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change."\n\n"The other thing was that it meant it was really happening. It wasn\'t a joke. It wasn\'t just statistics. It was really happening."\n\nHe calls his discovery Warming Island.\n\nMany climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth\'s climate are the result of an increase in the world\'s temperature, a trend widely called global warming.\n\nMany global warming experts say the phenomenon, if unchecked, is capable of altering the world\'s climate and geography. In the worst-case scenario, experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels, flooding cities and altering seashores.\n\nOther scientists and observers, a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous, say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet\'s life.\n\nMost of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere. But why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious.\n\nThe Earth\'s temperature averages about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (about 16 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe average surface temperature has warmed one degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) during the last century, according to the National Research Council.\n\nThe temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They rose till about 1945, cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day.\n\nThere are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say.\n\nA change in the Earth\'s orbit or the intensity of the sun\'s radiation could change, triggering warming or cooling.\n\nThe reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet\'s temperature at a comfortable level.\n\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age, according to the United Nations\' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, commonly referred to as the IPCC.\n\nThe presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels, but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades, according to the EPA. Meanwhile, nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years.\n\nMany scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests.\n\n"For the last 30 years, there\'s no way there\'s anything natural that can explain it," Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said.\n\n"A vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming," he added.\n\nMany scientific organizations share Schneider\'s view, ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the G8 to the National Research Council, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union.\n\nBut there are those who do not share his view, and among the skeptics is Richard Lindzen, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n"We\'ve suddenly taken to reading tea leaves," he said. "When we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970, we were proclaiming global cooling. Since then, there\'s been a few tenths of global warming, so we\'re proclaiming global warming."\n\nHe believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability, where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal.\n\n"The Earth is always getting colder and warmer," he said. "It\'s always changing. In fact, this is true of any fluid-covered planet."\n\nAsked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained.\n\n"We don\'t know why, but it\'s perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they\'ve occurred," he said. "What we\'re doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that\'s occurring due to global warming."\n\nYet, for Schneider, it is a cause for concern and alarm. "We\'re already in serious melt, nobody can explain it. The models don\'t predict it," he said. "We don\'t know what\'s going on up there. All we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty."\n\nThe greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world\'s nations.\n\nThe IPCC in February 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels, temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 4.5 degrees Celsius) by 2100.\n\nThe lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes, droughts, wildfires and flooding, Schneider said. The higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of Hollywood filmmakers.\n\nUncertainties, however, plague such forecasts, which are based on computer simulations and models. The models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere, oceans and continents interact, all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them.\n\n"Exactly how much it\'s going to warm up, we don\'t know," Schneider said. "That it\'s going to warm up? I\'d bet anything on that."

{'text': 'WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Bush administration hailed North Korea\'s declaration of its nuclear program as a success for the multilateral diplomacy it engaged in through the six party talks with South Korea, China, Japan and Russia.\n\n\n\nWorkers remove fuel rods on the reactor floor at North Korea\'s Yongbyon nuclear facility this year.\n\n\n\nIn fact, North Korea\'s confessions of many of its nuclear sins -- and its shutdown of its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon -- are the closest the international community has come to curbing North Korea\'s nuclear program.\n\n\n\nAs a result of Pyongyang\'s handover of the 60-page declaration document -- and Friday\'s expected destruction of the cooling tower at Yongbyon -- President Bush ordered some sanctions against North Korea lifted and instructed the State Department to remove the reclusive communist nation from U.S. lists of enemies and nations that support terrorism.\n\n\n\nBut as important as what the document says is what it doesn\'t say. There is no mention of how many weapons North Korea has or where they are hidden. Nor did North Korea admit to a suspected uranium enrichment program or what nuclear secrets it may have shared with Syria. Both issues are reduced in the declaration to "concerns" Pyongyang promises to address down the road.\n\n\n\nBush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have pledged a robust verification process to double-check North Korea\'s claims. And North Korea has promised to allow U.S. inspectors access to the Yongbyon facility and to interview its nuclear experts.\n\n\n\nBut it is far from clear whether Pyongyang will allow the kind of intrusive inspections of its entire nuclear arsenal that the United States will need to get a complete picture of North Korea\'s program.\n\n\n\nCongressional Republicans not so sure about Pyongyang\n\n\n\nThe stiffest opposition to the deal is coming from conservative Republicans. Once considered President Bush\'s strongest allies in confronting North Korea\'s nuclear ambition, they feel that the Bush administration has let North Korea off the hook, especially when it comes to its enriched uranium program and suspected proliferation to Syria.\n\n\n\nRep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, expressed "profound disappointment" over Bush\'s announcement that North Korea would be coming off the lists of enemies and state sponsors of terrorism.\n\n\n\nAnd Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Michigan, the top Republican on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, accused President Bush of sacrificing its principles for a foreign policy success.\n\n\n\n"A decision seemingly has been made that it is more important for the White House to reach a legacy agreement than to get to the bottom of North Korea\'s nuclear efforts," Hoekstra said. "Lifting sanctions and removing North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism flies in the face of history and rewards its brutal dictator for shallow gestures."\n\n\n\nRep. Ed Royce, R-California, called North Korea\'s declaration late and incomplete, alleging that North Korea built a nuclear facility for Syria, considered a terrorist state by the United States, while the nuclear negotiations were ongoing. That, he said, was proof that Pyongyang can\'t be trusted.\n\n\n\n"How do you have a meaningful declaration of your nuclear program without saying how many bombs you have?" Royce asked. "This is a signal to other proliferating regimes that nuclear weapons will be rewarded without ever having to give them up."\n\n\n\nDemocrats, who once criticized Bush for not talking directly to North Korea about its nuclear program, are cautiously supportive of the deal. Howard Berman, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the North\'s submission of a declaration "encouraging."\n\n\n\nEven former presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, praised the Bush administration, saying "engaging our enemies can pay dividends."\n\n\n\nBut Kerry added, "historians will long wonder why this administration did not directly engage North Korea before Pyongyang gathered enough material for several nuclear weapons, tested a nuclear device and the missiles to deliver them."\n\n\n\nAre we headed down the same road with Iran?\n\n\n\nIn his 2002 State of the Union address, Bush termed Iraq, North Korea and Iran the "axis of evil," saying they were "arming to threaten the peace of the world." Fourteen months after delivering that speech -- and after dictator Saddam Hussein released a 12,000-page declaration that it had no weapons of mass destruction -- U.S. forces invaded Iraq.\n\n\n\nBut no such program was found, nor were stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction. More than five years into the war, the United States is still battling al Qaeda and Iraqi insurgents there.\n\n\n\nSix-party talks with North Korea began in 2003, after North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Progress was limited until 2007, when North Korea agreed to shut down Yongbyon and allow international monitors back into the country for monitoring and verification.\n\n\n\nProgress has been even more limited for the third member of the "axis of evil," Iran.\n\n\n\nThe Bush administration has joined the other members of the U.N. Security Council -- Britain, France, China and Russia, along with Germany -- in offering Iran a set of political and economic incentives similar to the ones North Korea was given in exchange for suspending its uranium enrichment program.\n\n\n\nBut the United States has refused to sit down with Iran until that suspension takes place.\n\n\n\nThe U.N. Security Council has passed three resolutions imposing sanctions against Iran, and the United States has worked with some success to isolate Iran from the international financial community.\n\n\n\nBut unlike North Korea, which is isolated and desperately in need of international aid, Iran is rich in oil and a powerful force in the Middle East. And it\'s only getting richer and more immune to sanctions as oil prices skyrocket.\n\n\n\nAnd Iran seems to be running out the clock and waiting to try its luck with a new U.S. president.\n\n\n\nSen. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has pledged to engage Iran in direct talks to try to curb its nuclear ambitions. Sen. John McCain, the presumptive GOP nominee, has taken a much tougher line, refusing to rule out military action to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.\n\n\n\nWith the coming change in the U.S. administration, U.S. officials, diplomats and other Iran experts believe that it would be at least eight months to a year before the United States and Iran could seriously think about talking.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, by its own admission, Iran continues to perfect its nuclear technology.\n\n\n\nIf the North Korean experience can serve as a lesson for the next U.S. president, that lesson may well be that the longer the United States waits to talk to Iran, the higher the cost will be to get Tehran out of the nuclear business.', 'qa': [{'question': 'what is the reasoning behind this?', 'answers': ['North Korea, which is isolated and desperately in need of international aid,']}, {'question': 'Who says the Bush administration has let Pyongyang off the hook?', 'answers': ['conservative Republicans.', 'Congressional Republicans']}, {'question': 'what does it say or not say?', 'answers': ['is', 'suspected uranium enrichment program', 'reduced', 'There is no mention of how', 'where they are hidden.', "doesn't", 'nuclear secrets', 'many weapons North Korea has', 'is no mention of how', 'where they are hidden.

{'text': '(CNN) -- The nation\'s new "first dog" has heightened interest in its breed -- Portuguese water dog -- but not necessarily a thorough understanding of the dogs\' needs, a pair of owners and breeders told CNN.\n\n\n\nBo the Portuguese water dog meets the camera. Bo was a gift to the Obama girls from Sen. Ted Kennedy.\n\n\n\nThe dog, Bo, has triggered "the most publicity the breed has ever had since its introduction into the U.S. in the late 1960s," the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America said in a news release.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama and his family welcomed Bo into the White House this week. Shortly afterward, the club\'s Web site was receiving a million hits an hour, said Susan Teasley, a club member.\n\n\n\nJane Harding, a fellow member of the club, said she has "received about a 10 percent increase in calls" since Tuesday, and some of the other breeders she knows also have reported more calls.\n\n\n\n"Thankfully, people want to know more about the breed," Teasley said. "But water dogs are not for everybody, and it would be sad to see people getting the dog without doing the proper research."\n\n\n\nPortuguese water dogs are "active athletes," far from couch potatoes, she explained.\n\n\n\nIn fact, they are more likely to rip a couch into pieces than lounge on it, Harding said, recalling a friend who had lost a sofa that way.  Watch more water dog fun »\n\n\n\nPortuguese water dogs can be miserable and destructive when alone, Teasley said.\n\n\n\nAnd don\'t think you can close the door and keep them out. "They want to be with you at all times -- even if it\'s in the bathroom or your bed," she said.\n\n\n\nTeasley and her husband breed Portuguese water dogs and often allow them to run free on the two and a half acres of land they own. They are "not apartment dogs," she said.\n\n\n\nHarding agreed. "They aren\'t for people who want a tie-out dog or an apartment dog. For people like that," she joked, "we recommend a stuffed dog."\n\n\n\nPortuguese water dogs love the outdoors, particularly if they have a garden to eat from, Teasley said as she wrestled to keep 7-month-old Misty Morning from eating the family\'s flowers.\n\n\n\nHarding said she believes the first family will be successful with their new dog because "they have access to the best trainers, and they want to make this work."\n\n\n\nFor other Americans thinking about following suit, she cautioned, "Buyers beware. Do your homework and first read the information on the breed."\n\n\n\nTeasley wants people to understand the breed to help avoid what she called the "Dalmatian syndrome."\n\n\n\nAfter the movie "101 Dalmatians" came out in 1996, "thousands of people rushed to get the dog, and thousands of dogs ended up in rescue kennels," Teasley said.\n\n\n\nWhat those who followed the Dalmatian trend may not have known is that Dalmatians shed profusely and they develop hearing problems, making it hard to train and call them, she said.\n\n\n\nBoth Teasley and Harding advised owners to get a mentor, as they expect Sen. Ted Kennedy to be to the Obama family. Kennedy owns Portuguese water dogs himself and recommended the breed to the Obamas.  Watch Obamas introduce dog »\n\n\n\n"For the first six to seven months of the puppy\'s life, they need training," Harding said.\n\n\n\nShe has diligently trained 8-year-old champion Bessie, who she said "produces phenomenal litters ... and has multiple titles" from the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America.\n\n\n\nSuch organizations provide guidance to first-time dog owners. But it takes time to get a membership, Teasley said. Prospective members must apply for a one-year associate membership before they can receive a permanent one, she explained. That provides a cushion while they decide whether the dog is the right fit.\n\n\n\n"It sounds like I\'m trying to discourage people from getting (a Portuguese water dog)," Teasley said, "But I\'m not. We just don\'t want dogs to come back because owners don\'t know what they are doing."', 'qa': [{'question': 'What dog breed is described as "active athletes"?', 'answers': ['Portuguese water', 'from couch potatoes, she explained.', 'athletes,"', 'are', 'athletes," far from couch potatoes, she explained.']}, {'question': 'What do dogs bond quickly with?', 'answers': ['Portuguese water']}, {'question': 'What are Portugese water dogs like?', 'answers': ['are "active athletes," far from couch potatoes,', '"active athletes," far from couch potatoes, she explained.', 'Portuguese']}, {'question': 'Who is more likely to rip up the couch, than lounge on it?', 'answers': ['Portuguese water dogs']}, {'question': 'What issue is the breeders concerned about?', 'answers': ["a thorough understanding of the dogs' needs,", "thorough understanding of the dogs' needs,"]}, {'question': 'Who is Bo the dog?', 'answers': ['gift to the Obama girls from Sen.
